# Pedagogical Principles Applied to Feedback Design

This document explains the educational theory and best practices applied to improve the feedback in Unit 7.

## 1. Constructive Alignment (Biggs & Tang, 2011)

**Principle:** Feedback should align with learning objectives and help students understand what they need to know.

**Application:**
- Learning objective: "Find synonyms in academic text"
- Feedback explains: WHERE to find them, WHY they're synonyms, HOW to recognize them in future
- Goes beyond just "right/wrong" to build transferable skills

**Example:**
```
"The correct answer is 'dwelling' (or 'building'). Tip: Academic texts use 
formal vocabulary. Instead of repeating 'house', writers use words like 
'dwelling', 'building', or 'property'."
```

## 2. Scaffolding (Vygotsky's ZPD)

**Principle:** Provide graduated support that helps students bridge from current to desired knowledge.

**Application:**
- **Level 1:** Give the correct answer
- **Level 2:** Show where to find it ("Look in paragraph 3")
- **Level 3:** Explain why it's correct ("Both mean 'usual' or 'standard'")
- **Level 4:** Provide strategy for similar questions ("Tip: Start by reading the first sentence")

**Example:**
```
Incorrect: "The correct answer is 'common'. Look at the very first sentence 
where it describes 'the common design of a house'. In academic writing, 
'common' and 'typical' both mean 'usual' or 'standard'."
```

## 3. Metacognitive Awareness (Flavell, 1979)

**Principle:** Help students think about their own thinking and develop self-regulation strategies.

**Application:**
- Explicit strategy teaching: "Strategy: Create a checklist of all 9 labelled parts"
- Process transparency: Shows the checking process with ✓ and ✗
- Transferable techniques: "IELTS Task 1 strategy: Count... then check..."

**Example:**
```
"Check systematically: glass bulb ✓, electrical contact ✓, metal cap ✓, 
stem ✓, low pressure inert gas ✓, contact wire in ✓, contact wire out ✓, 
tungsten filament ✓, but support wires ✗"
```

## 4. Error Analysis (Corder, 1967)

**Principle:** Errors are valuable learning opportunities; analyze WHY students make mistakes.

**Application:**
- Identifies specific misconceptions: "This focuses on SIZE and POSITION rather than..."
- Explains the flawed reasoning before showing correct reasoning
- Contrasts wrong approach with correct approach

**Example:**
```
"Not quite. This focuses on SIZE and POSITION rather than the actual 
organizing principle. Look again: Paragraph 1 has cap, electric contact, 
glass bulb (all EXTERNAL/visible from outside). The organization is 
external vs internal, not biggest vs center vs remaining."
```

## 5. Formative Assessment (Black & Wiliam, 1998)

**Principle:** Feedback should promote learning, not just measure it.

**Application:**
- Every feedback message teaches something beyond the specific answer
- Provides forward-looking guidance for improvement
- Builds understanding of academic writing conventions

**Example:**
```
"Paraphrasing tip: 'from the UK' (prepositional phrase) → 'British' 
(adjective). This makes the sentence more concise. Compare 'tourists 
from the UK' with 'British tourists'."
```

## 6. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)

**Principle:** Reduce extraneous cognitive load; focus attention on what matters.

**Application:**
- Specific location hints reduce searching time
- Direct quotes eliminate need to scan entire text
- Clear structure: Answer first, then explanation
- Visual aids (✓✗) for quick understanding

**Example:**
```
"Look in paragraph 3 where it says 'The dwelling has a sizeable double 
garage'."  // Student can find it immediately, not waste time searching
```

## 7. Vocabulary Acquisition (Nation, 2001)

**Principle:** Vocabulary learning requires multiple types of knowledge about words.

**Application:**
- Form: Shows the word itself
- Meaning: Explains what it means
- Use: Shows it in context
- Collocations: Shows how it's used in phrases
- Register: Explains formality level

**Example:**
```
"In formal IELTS writing, 'dwelling' is a sophisticated alternative to 
'house' or 'home'. 'Building' also appears in the text."
```

## 8. Task-Based Language Teaching (Ellis, 2003)

**Principle:** Language learning is most effective when focused on meaningful tasks.

**Application:**
- Feedback relates to authentic IELTS task requirements
- Explains real-world applications ("what examiners look for")
- Connects to test performance outcomes

**Example:**
```
"a crucial omission that would lose marks"
"This is excellent essay organization... a great strategy for describing 
diagrams in IELTS Task 1"
```

## 9. Growth Mindset (Dweck, 2006)

**Principle:** Frame feedback to encourage effort and strategy, not just ability.

**Application:**
- Emphasizes strategies and techniques that can be learned
- Shows the process, not just the product
- Encourages systematic approaches anyone can use

**Example:**
```
"Tip: When you see words like 'also includes', they often introduce 
something additional."  // Anyone can learn to notice this pattern
```

## 10. Differentiated Instruction (Tomlinson, 2001)

**Principle:** Provide multiple entry points for different learning needs.

**Application:**
- Quick answer for those who just need correction
- Detailed explanation for deep learners
- Visual elements (✓✗) for visual learners
- Strategy tips for strategic learners
- Examples for those who learn from models

## Feedback Template Structure

Each feedback message follows this proven structure:

```
1. ANSWER: State the correct answer clearly
   "The correct answer is 'X'."

2. LOCATION: Where to find it (reduces cognitive load)
   "Look in paragraph 3 where it says..."

3. EXPLANATION: Why it's correct (builds understanding)
   "In academic writing, 'X' and 'Y' both mean..."

4. STRATEGY: How to approach similar questions (metacognition)
   "Tip: Start by reading..." OR "Strategy: Create a checklist..."

5. TRANSFER: How this applies elsewhere (generalization)
   "This is useful for..." OR "Good paraphrasing uses..."
```

## Measurable Improvements

The new feedback design should lead to:

1. **Reduced time to understanding** - Students find answers faster with location hints
2. **Improved retention** - Understanding WHY improves memory
3. **Strategy transfer** - Students apply techniques to new questions
4. **Vocabulary development** - Learning word relationships, not just memorizing
5. **Test performance** - Understanding examiner expectations
6. **Self-efficacy** - Students feel equipped with strategies, not helpless
