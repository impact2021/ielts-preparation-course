In many cases, (3)__________ can lead to the student dropping out of the course or simply being unable to complete assignments or examinations.

Select the correct answers.\n\nEmails, internal telephone systems, text messaging – regardless of the efforts made by the majority of companies, miscommunication between departments is causing a not insignificant loss of productivity for some companies. Psychologist Dr David Barnett believes that technology, far from enhancing working relationships, is actually having a detrimental effect. He believes that some people are under the misconception that information can be exchanged efficiently by writing an email and sending it to all their colleagues. However, states Dr Barnett, the written word accounts for less than 50% of the message we are giving than when we talk face to face. Body language, attitude and tone of voice actually compose more of the message than the words themselves, and it is these cues that are getting lost by our over reliance on technology.\n\nIBL Logistics, a company based in Germany, has taken Barnett's research into consideration. Internal emails are strictly limited, and regular face to face meetings are held in all departments. In many respects, the company operation is not dissimilar to the way companies traditionally ran some thirty years ago, yet this is not to say that they are not at the cutting edge of their field. In the last year alone, they have generated sales almost equal to their $80 million profit from the previous three years from hardware and software logistics packages.",
