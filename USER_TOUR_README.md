## 🎯 Quick Answer to Your Question

> "How difficult would it be to create a user tour for first time users? Would I have to add a shortcode for each stage or how would it work?"

> "I would also want it to do things like highlight a button or an area (e.g. Submit a quiz)"

### Answer:

**Difficulty**: Easy to Moderate (1-2 hours)

**No shortcodes needed!** The tour is JavaScript-based. You define all tour steps in one JavaScript file.

**Highlighting is automatic!** When you point to an element (like a submit button), it automatically gets highlighted with a glow effect while the rest of the page dims. No extra code needed!

**What you need:**
1. Add Shepherd.js library (via CDN) - 2 minutes
2. Create tour configuration file - 20 minutes  
3. Add simple AJAX handler - 2 minutes
4. Test and refine - 30 minutes

**Total time**: ~1 hour for basic implementation

**Highlighting example:**
```javascript
tour.addStep({
    text: 'Click here to submit your quiz!',
    attachTo: { 
        element: 'button[type="submit"]',  // Submit button gets highlighted!
        on: 'top' 
    }
});
```

The button will glow, the page will dim, and the user can't miss it! ✨

## 💡 Key Points

### No Shortcodes Required
Unlike other WordPress features, the tour doesn't need shortcodes. You define all steps in JavaScript:

```javascript
tour.addStep({
    id: 'welcome',
    text: 'Welcome to IELTS Course!',
    buttons: [
        { text: 'Next', action: tour.next }
    ]
});
```

### Automatic Element Highlighting
When you want to highlight a button or area (like "Submit Quiz"), just point to it:

```javascript
tour.addStep({
    id: 'submit-button',
    text: 'Click here when you finish!',
    attachTo: { 
        element: 'button[type="submit"]',  // ← This button gets highlighted!
        on: 'top'  // Tooltip appears above
    }
});
```

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ The element **glows** with a spotlight effect
- ✅ Rest of page **dims** (dark overlay)
- ✅ Element **scrolls into view** smoothly
- ✅ **Tooltip appears** next to the element
- ✅ User **can't miss it**!

**No extra code needed** - highlighting is built into Shepherd.js!

### Easy Setup for You
As requested, the setup is as easy as possible:

1. **Copy 3 code blocks** into existing files
2. **Create 1 new JavaScript file** with your tour steps
3. **Update CSS selectors** to match your site (5 minutes)
4. **Test** - Clear cache and reload

Done! 🎉

### Adding More Steps Later
Just edit the JavaScript file and add new steps:

```javascript
tour.addStep({
    id: 'new-feature',
    text: 'Check out this new feature!',
    attachTo: { element: '.new-feature-selector', on: 'bottom' }
});
```

No database changes, no shortcodes, no complexity.
