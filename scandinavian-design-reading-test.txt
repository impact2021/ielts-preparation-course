[READING PASSAGE] Reading Passage 2 - Scandinavian Design

The story behind the furniture from the Nordic countries.

Traditionally, Scandinavia was recognised as the three kingdoms of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but today that scope has widened to include both Finland and Iceland as well. With an impressive international reputation, designers and craftspeople from all five countries are often grouped under the collective name 'Scandinavian design', creating furniture with a unique and often simple appeal. It is claimed that the expression 'Scandinavian design' first came from a design exhibition which toured Canada and the United States in the mid-20th century, from 1954 to 1957, although there had been earlier exhibitions in Europe and North America showcasing the works of Scandinavian designers.

To understand both the origins and the concepts of Scandinavian design it is perhaps best to look at the historical context with some of the major trends in art and manufacturing through the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Industrial Revolution, generally considered to have been at its height in the first half of the 19th century, design was focused purely on being useful and functional. At the same time, Realism, a form of art that sprang from the introduction of the photograph, was used as a way to capture 'reality', and was linked to the reality of the mass production of the Industrial Revolution.

The late 19th century saw the beginning of the Art Nouveau movement, which was seen as a reaction against the functional style of the industrial revolution. This new form of art incorporated not only art, but also architecture, design, furniture and jewellery, and was strongly based on nature with its fluid and natural shapes. Art Nouveau continued through the turn of the century and led to the birth of Modernism, the new movement which had links to social movements and political activism at the beginning of the 20th century. Events such as the horrors of the First World War drove the movement on, and there was a growing ideal which saw a tremendous reaction against the existing norms, which resulted in a range of art movements forming, all sharing a similar reactionary bent.

In 1914, a magazine was first published in Denmark called Skønvirke, which drew on the inspirations of traditional Danish, and by extension Scandinavian, design and local handicrafts. This design was seen as being functional, featuring simple lines and a minimalist element, while at the same time is was still designed to look appealing. It is noted that Scandinavian design is known as 'democratic design' because the masses are attracted to its affordability and accessibility, as well as the aesthetics (aesthetics being defined as the principle of nature and the appreciation of beauty). Wood was a major component in the construction of furniture from Scandinavian countries, and again this was driven by the constraining factors of the time: the difficulty in importing materials and economic issues leading to production problems. But, as a result, the finished products took on an identity of their own due to the signature wood design and the simplicity of the shape and the textures involved.

In the 1920s and 1930s, other Art Movements in Europe began exploring new concepts and, interestingly, their work embraced not only the final product but also the manufacturing process. Bauhaus in Germany and Dadaism in Switzerland were two of the more notable movements exploring these new concepts, along with Italy's Futurists and De Stijl in the Netherlands, who saw everything reduced to the simplest forms of lines and colour. As these ideas spread throughout the world, artists and designers from outside the region started integrating Scandinavian concepts of art and construction. However, as the 20th century progressed, the mass production techniques that were enveloping much of the rest of the world was not as prevalent in the Nordic countries, which were working to preserve the traditions of their crafts. In fact, preservation of these traditions had been a consideration in Scandinavia as far back as 1845, when the Swedish Society of Industrial Design was founded to ensure the highest levels of quality were maintained, while keeping safe the tradition of hand crafts. However, even Scandinavia was not immune to the need for mass production, and it is claimed that this focus on the detail of craftwork and merging it with commercial production has given rise to the term 'industrial arts'.

A number of Scandinavian designers have now become household names, at least within the international household of design. Denmark's Verner Panton created, in 1960, the famous single-molded plastic chair, symbolising the emerging Pop Art movement and exemplifying the famous simple lines and designs. Alvar Aalto, from Finland, worked with wood in his furniture manufacturing, and established a company which also championed other Finnish designers, and branched out into the production of accessories, such as lamps and textiles. The Danish architect Arne Jacobson began working with plywood in the 1950s, and although this material had been used for time, Jacobson perfected new techniques which allowed the plywood to be bent, while keeping its inherent strength, and in 1955 created a chair design which is still sold today. Eero Aarnio, from Finland, worked with fibreglass and came up with such simple but futuristic shapes that some of his designs have been utilized in science-fiction films as props.

In addition to furniture, Scandinavian design has also been applied to crafts and accessories. Tappo Wirkkal, from Finland, and Sweden's Kosta Boda company both work with glass, and have created works which have drawn praise from art critics as well as withstanding the test of functional design criteria. Today, the design concepts of Scandinavia have progressed beyond product and furniture manufacture and production and now embrace environmental considerations as well. The iconic Swedish company IKEA, for example, is insistent on only using timber from certified forests – a guarantee that it has not been illegally logged – as well as supporting 14 projects run by the World Wildlife Federation.
