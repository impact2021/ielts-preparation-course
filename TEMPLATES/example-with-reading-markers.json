Since participants in the programmes are helping to bring genuine benefit to impoverished areas, such an experience can be not only personally rewarding, but helpful with future employment searches, employers often holding the view that travel and in particular voluntary work overseas help to develop maturity, independence and team-building skills in potential graduate employees.</p><p>Employment Agency Consultant Lucy Clarke says such experience can add tremendous value to applicants' resumes and positively impact on their success at reaching interview stage. She adds that it is helpful for students to plan a gap year placement which will involve functions and responsibilities somehow related to their chosen future career if at all possible, though [Q1]Scott Bradley warns that some students from some particular study disciplines may find that their own industry is less receptive to the advantages of a gap year than others. For example, graduates of a technology-related degree could find themselves at a disadvantage on their return as knowledge and applications within the industry are so dynamic.</p>"

            "content": "<p>To compress thousands of years of history in a few paragraphs is a difficult task, and as with almost any historical point a millennia old, even 'facts' are disputable. What is generally accepted is that the first notable new arrivals to Britain came over 2000 years ago in the form of an army of Romans. Conflicts ensued with the tribal populations of Britain, but the organised martial might of the Romans proved superior, and for the following century, Roman influence spread throughout what is now known as England.</p><p>Yet this was not a true invasion, as it was not until nearly 100 years later that Rome decided it wanted Britain to be part of the Roman Empire. Consequently, [Q2]in 43 A.D., the first full scale invasion took place in the South East of England. Some thirty years later, Roman control had spread throughout England and Wales, although Scotland had remained defiant. Frequent incursions into England from tribes in Scotland led to the creation of one of Britain's most impressive constructions – Hadrian's Wall. The wall was built right across the border of Scotland and designed to protect 'Brittania', the Roman name given to England and Wales.</p><p>Yet for 300 years, invasions from the Picts and the Scots (both tribes from Scotland) continued to harass the Romans. By 400 A.D., with the Roman Empire collapsing due to rebellions in Europe, the Roman army in Britannia was seriously weakened. Invasions by the Picts and Scots pressed deeper into what was Roman control, and new invaders arrived – the Saxons from modern-day Germany.</p>"
