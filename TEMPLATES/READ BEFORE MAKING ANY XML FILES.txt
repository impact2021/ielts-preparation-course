Important points to keep in mind when creating new exercises from templates:

- Ensure you ALWAYS fill EVERY feedback field.
- The correct answer must always be clear when a user entered an incorrect answer or no answer. Simply writing 'Please select an answer.' is not enough. Ideally you would also identify which paragraph / area of the text should have led them to the correct answer.
- ensure that the right questions are linked with the right reading passages for reading exercises
- with groups of question types, the instruction should only be in the first of the group.
