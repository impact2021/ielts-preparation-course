## 🔴 PROBLEM TESTS

### Test 20 - TOO DIFFICULT
**Why it's too hard:**
- 🧪 **Ocean Acidification:** Requires chemistry knowledge (carbonate ions, aragonite, calcification)
- 🌊 **Ancient Navigation:** Requires physics, oceanography, astronomy knowledge (wave interference, celestial navigation)
- 📚 **Vocabulary:** 45+ specialized scientific terms across 3 passages

**Example of excessive vocabulary:**
> "pteropods, aragonite shells, calcifying organisms, wave interference patterns, celestial navigation, kamal, gnomon, polarized light"

**Action:** Mark as "Advanced/Specialized" or remove from standard practice

---

### Test 17 - TOO DIFFICULT + BROKEN
**Why it's too hard:**
- 🌱 **Urban Agriculture:** Excessive jargon (aquaponics, aeroponics, multispectral cameras)
- 🧠 **Color Psychology:** Specialized terminology
- 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG:** 15 questions not linked to passages (Q6-12, Q20-23, Q33-36)

**Action:** Fix bugs FIRST, then simplify or mark as advanced

---

### Test 13 - BORDERLINE
**Why it's challenging:**
- ⏰ **Clocks:** Requires physics background (pendulum mechanics)
- 😔 **Psychology:** Medical terminology (SAD, melatonin)

**Action:** Review and consider marking as "Advanced"
