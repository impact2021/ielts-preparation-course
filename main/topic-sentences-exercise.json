There is a significant risk of accidentally discharging the weapon, or using it in a moment of anger, resulting in injury or death that could not have occurred if the weapon had been banned. There are numerous cases where children, finding a weapon in the house, have used it with deadly consequence when only intending to use it as a toy.</p>"

Many products have significant quantities of sugar, preservatives and artificial additives, and the connection between the intake of such foods and subsequent behaviour is becoming increasingly apparent. A clear example can be seen in the number of hours children are allowed to stay indoors, forsaking more traditional activities for computer games and television programmes.</p>"
