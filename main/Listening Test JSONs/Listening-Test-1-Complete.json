They run for <strong>two weeks</strong> with <strong>two one-hour sessions each week</strong>. The idea is that if you are having any specific difficulties settling into your new life, be that work or social issues, your mentor can talk with you and give suggestions and advice on how to make things better.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>We currently have <strong>15 mentors</strong> on the team, and each will mentor <strong>four</strong> clients per week. The mentor programme is free, but we suggest people join the Settlement Support Programme first, then enrol on a Mentoring Programme afterwards if they still feel in need of additional support.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Woman:</strong> Okay, I understand. Thank you. So, what do I need to do about enrolling on the Settlement Support Programme? I'd like to enrol as soon as I can.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Telephone Operator:</strong> Well, you will need to come into our office and fill out an application form. Make sure that you bring your passport with you to confirm your residency, and we will also need two additional passport photographs: one for our records and one for your student ID card.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Woman:</strong> Okay. I'll come in this afternoon. So, when does the next course start?</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Telephone Operator:</strong> The next course starts next Monday, on the <strong>26th September</strong>, but that one is already fully booked. We have new courses starting each week, so the next with an available place is on the <strong>3rd October</strong>.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Woman:</strong> Okay. Well, thanks very much for your help. It sounds like the Settlement Support Programme is ideal for me, and I'll think later about whether to apply for Mentor Support. I'll come in very soon. Can you just remind me where the office is?</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Telephone Operator:</strong> Yes, we're on the <strong>2nd floor</strong> of the Lakeside View building on St James Plaza. We are in the tall white building next to the technical college. We're very easy to find, and there are plenty of places to park in the public car park just to the left of the building. Don't use the <strong>car</strong> park at the front though, as those spaces are reserved for staff.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Woman:</strong> That's great! Thank you very much for all your help. Looking forward to meeting you when I come in later today.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p><strong>Telephone Operator:</strong> You're very welcome. Glad I could help.</p>"

The 56km of rough, shark-infested waters and its venomous snakes arguably making it the ideal place to house the most violent criminals of the time, as these hazards usually put an end to any hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe prison was operational until (11) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q1: 1985]</strong> when the penal facility was closed and Gorgona Island was declared a natural national park by the Colombian Government, UNESCO having recognised the island a World Heritage Site in the previous year, 1984.\r\n\r\nGorgona Island is known as the 'Science Island' due to its coral reef and tropical rainforest ecosystems and the (12) research possibilities they present. The island was originally discovered in 1524 by Diego de Almagro, who gave Gorgona Island its name due to the large number of reptiles and the association with the Gorgons from Greek mythology – 'woman-demons with the hair of snakes'.\r\n\r\nGorgona Island is home to a wealth of native plant and animal species in its rainforests. On its (13) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q3: eastern side]</strong>, the island also boasts some of the finest white-sand beaches in Colombia, while the west coast is made up of cliffs. There are also several hills on the island, the tallest being La Trinidad which peaks at 388 meters. While the prison buildings remain, they are now overgrown with dense vegetation and provide a (14) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q4: perfect environment]</strong> in which to observe all kinds of wildlife such as monkeys swinging through the vines.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the environment, visitors who travel to Gorgona Island are strictly supervised, are limited to groups of 80 at a time, and are also prohibited from wandering too far away from the coastline. Especially during high season, it is advised that reservations are made one or two months in advance in order to avoid disappointment as visitor quotas are staunchly upheld and quickly filled.\r\n\r\nTourists are required to strictly follow the rules of the Natural Park at all times to preserve the flora and fauna on the island.\r\n\r\n(15 or 16) Electrical appliances such as stoves and hair dryers, alcoholic beverages, sprays and other contaminants, arms, and articles for hunting or capturing animals are banned and must not be brought to the island. No non-biodegradable rubbish must be left behind. Any organic waste should be placed in special containers found in the park for collection by rangers.\r\n\r\n(15 or 16) Visitors are also required get vaccinated against yellow fever, tetanus, and hepatitis B at least 10 days before arriving on the island (vaccination certificates must be shown on entrance to the park). In the interests of their own safety, while not compulsory, visitors are also strongly recommended to take a first aid kit that includes multipurpose snake anti-venom and medicine for diarrhoea, along with rubber boots, a change of clothes, and sun block.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely strictly forbidden is the collecting of shells, coral or other mineral material from the protected area and the taking of any seeds, plants or animals, all of which could have catastrophic effect on the island's ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial animal population on Gorgona Island includes sloths, blue lizards, fresh water turtles, snakes, and babilla alligators. (17) There are 147 bird species, over 100 insect species, more than 500 species of marine fauna. There are also hundreds of species of marine and terrestrial plant life on Gorgona Island.\r\n\r\nThe sea around Gorgona Island has the most developed and diverse coral bank in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, which is also the largest in the country's Pacific region. The island's surrounding waters provide tourists with a great opportunity to observe, amongst other species, dolphins, porpoises, sharks, sperm whales and humpback whales, the latter also known as the Yubarta whale.\r\n\r\nThe Colombian Pacific coast is the mating and birthing area for the humpback whale, which migrates between June and October each year. Almost all humpback whales found in this region are born in Colombian waters and are faithful to their birthplace, travelling 8000Km from the poles to have their babies and feed them in the warmer waters of Gorgona Island. (18) With more than 1000 humpback whales arriving in Gorgona Island's waters during mating and calving season, tourists need not be concerned that their whale-watching trip will be unsuccessful, rather how just many of these majestic creatures they will be able to see.\r\n\r\nRelatively few people can boast of a trip to Gorgona Island. Not only are visitor numbers restricted, but the trip is also difficult and is becoming increasingly expensive. The boat ride from Buenaventura (a coastal city of more than 300,000 people situated about 10 hours from Bogota and four hours from Cali) takes (19) 12 hours. Alternatively it is an hour-and-40-minute boat ride from Guapi, an Afro-pacific town near the border of Ecuador, but no roads lead to Guapi. Guapi's single-runway Juan Casino Solis Airport does, however, service flights to and from the southern cities of Cali and Popyan.\r\n\r\nUntil 2009, visitors could make day trips to Gorgona from Guapi or spend a night there for as little as US$12. However, in that same year the government decided to give (20) a private company sole control over all tourism on Gorgona Island which resulted in exponential price increases. Since then a park permit, night in a basic bungalow in the remodelled prison-guard quarters, three meals and a return boat ride from Guapi can cost at least US$250, and additional nights around US$150. All activities — whale watching, snorkelling, even walking around the island — are extra. While these prices may still be in the price range for overseas visitors, they are prohibitively expensive for many locals.\r\n\r\nThe people who do make it to Gorgona, however, can rest assured that they will be left blissfully alone in extraordinarily wild surroundings, and know that since such small numbers visit the island, its incredible ecosystem can continue to flourish.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"

It was really interesting. It started by talking about the divorce rate and the myth that half of marriages end in divorce.  \r\nApparently there are approximately 10,000 divorces and 20,000 marriages in New Zealand each year. That causes people to think the divorce rate is 50%. In reality though, statistics show that just under <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q21: 1/3]</strong> of couples who married in 1970 had divorced by their jade wedding anniversary. Of those who married in 1980, just under 1/3 of couples had already divorced by their silver wedding anniversary.

Two very significant trends since that time are that people are more likely to live with a partner before marrying now than in previous years, and <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q23: birth rates]</strong> are on the decrease. There has been an increase in single-parent families and an increase in blended families – when people who have been married and divorced meet a new partner and join their children to make a new family.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 2</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Don't more people live by themselves these days too?

The programme said that <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q24: single person]</strong> households are a growing family form. They compared two years – 2006 when 23% of households were that type, and 2021 by which time they are expected to grow to 26%. A lot of single-person households are made up of older people who may have lost their partner. Like most countries in the developed world, New Zealand's ageing population is growing, as people continue to live longer, so this type of living situation is expected to rise.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 2</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Yeah, I suppose that's true.

Childless households are expected to increase much faster than couples with children over the next few decades. Of course, people who have children are more often deciding to have smaller families and are putting parenthood off until later in life. In 2007, the average age of women giving birth to their first child was 28 years; I think it's risen to around 30 years now.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 2</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">I suppose a lot of people want to get their career established, maybe buy a house, those sorts of things first, don't they?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 1</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">\r\nYes, that's true. <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q26: Younger people]</strong> nowadays also appreciate a few years of freedom with no family commitments.

With more people choosing not to have kids, getting married later and concentrating on their careers, there's going to be more elderly people with no one to support them. I mean, traditionally, families looked after the elderly members in their homes, but even now <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q27: an increasing number]</strong> of people are spending their old age in a retirement home because either the family is spread geographically or their children work so much they aren't able to give them the time they need.\r\nDid the programme suggest that relationships and families are becoming less important to people in general?\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 1</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">\r\nNo, they indicated that the decline of the traditional family structure was more about social acceptance of other forms and people taking advantage of the increasing number of choices.

People are becoming more materialistic, but more importantly we are becoming less sociable. <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q28–30: The feeling of community]</strong> is disappearing, because people are using texts, email and social media to interact with others rather than talking.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">Speaker 2</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">\r\nWell, that's not really a new point of view, is it?

                "transcript": "<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<div style=\"height: 300px;overflow: scroll\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Section 4</strong>\r\n\r\nIn today's lecture we will look at factors that affect the election process.\r\nAn election is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses a representative to take on a specific responsibility. Elections have been operated in modern democratic societies since the 17th century.\r\n\r\nSix types of elections are held in the United Kingdom. These are: General elections to appoint National Government, European Parliament elections, local elections to appoint Local Government, Mayoral elections and Police and Crime Commissioner elections. Unlike other types, General elections do not have (31) <u><strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q1: fixed dates]</strong></u>; though in the UK the political party in power is required to call an election at least every five years.\r\n\r\nAnyone who lives in the UK, is aged 18 or over on polling day and who is a national of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, a Commonwealth country, Cyprus or a European Union member state can apply to be included in the UK Electoral Register. Convicted persons detained in prison or a mental hospital or a person who has ever been found guilty of certain illegal practices (such as corruption) are not <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q2: eligible]</strong> to vote.\r\n\r\nWe'll now move on to 'voter turnout' - this is the percentage of (32) eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. One of the strongest factors affecting voter turnout is whether voting is compulsory. In <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q3: Australia]</strong>, for example, voter registration and attendance at a polling booth have been mandatory since the 1920s. Since Australia typically has around 10% of eligible voters who are not registered to vote and around 6% of invalid votes, actual voter turnouts in Australia are usually (33) close to 81%.\r\n\r\nIn countries where voting is not compulsory, many members of the population who are entitled to vote, do not exercise their rights and do not go to polling stations on election day. Numerous reports from various countries around the world suggest that fewer voters are turning out for elections than in the past.\r\n\r\nThis falling trend has been significant in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and (34) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q4: Latin America]</strong>. For example, the percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but this percentage has been falling ever since. Voter turnout in 2008 was 62% - the only year since the 1960s when a similar turnout was achieved.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that socioeconomic factors significantly affect whether or not individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely he or she is to vote. (35 or 36) Income appears to have some independent effect too, as studies show that richer people are more likely to vote than poor people, regardless of their educational background. Young people are far less likely to vote than older generations, and (35 or 36) single people are less likely to vote than married people.\r\n\r\n'Voter apathy' (lack of caring) poses a huge problem for parties and individuals reliant on their supporters casting a ballot on election day.\r\nOverall, voter apathy is lower in national government elections than other types of elections, but a number of specific factors have been identified as important influences on voter apathy. These include how the voter sees the parties, the candidates, and the importance of the issues in an election.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how voters see the parties and candidates up for election, lack of trust or a feeling that nothing will change regardless of who wins the election are opinions that can increase voter apathy. Why bother if all parties are corrupt and nothing gets better anyway? It is therefore important for leaders and parties to inspire (37) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q7: confidence]</strong> so that more voters will turn out to give them their backing.\r\n\r\nIn theory, another factor that is likely to increase turnout is a 'close race' – where election outcome could easily go either way. In elections where it seems clear that one party or candidate will win, voter apathy may increase as people think why bother if the outcome is inevitable. This can actually be a huge concern for the favoured candidate or party, as if their supporters do not turn out on election day, their competitor can achieve an unexpected win.\r\n\r\nThe perceived importance of issues in an election also influences voter turnout and increases or decreases voter apathy in the following ways. If the issues in an election are not of (38) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q8: personal importance]</strong> to a voter, their apathy may be increased. For example, an election campaign focussed on improving the circumstances of families may not be of interest to individuals without children. Conversely, if an election campaign focuses on topics that will affect an individual's life, they are more likely to vote.\r\n\r\nVoter fatigue (tiredness) is also a form of voter apathy which occurs when voters are expected to vote too often. For instance, this happened in Canada when voters were asked to vote in a federal election three times in five years (2004, 2006, 2008) and at each election voter turnout significantly decreased.\r\n\r\nOther practical issues also affect voter turnout. For example, (39) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q9: bad weather]</strong> can reduce turnouts. How easy it is to vote is also a concern. In many states in America and most Latin American nations, voters must go through separate voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly appears to decrease turnout as U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements consistently have larger turnouts.\r\n\r\nThe final issue relating to collecting valid votes that I will discuss today is known as 'ballot fatigue'. Many people are simply very lazy when it comes to voting so they may just pick the first candidates they see on the ballot just to get it over with. In a case of ballot fatigue it would therefore follow that the farther down the candidate list a candidate is, the fewer the number of votes they will collect. The ballot fatigue principle suggests that affected voters use up all their patience and/or their (40) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow\">[Q10: knowledge]</strong> as they work their way down the ballot and make an 'easy' choice to get the process over.\r\n\r\nPossible methods of improving voting processes focus on making voting easier; for example, making ballot papers more user-friendly; increasing the number of possible voting locations; lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line; or encouraging companies to give workers some time off on voting day.\r\n\r\n</div></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"
