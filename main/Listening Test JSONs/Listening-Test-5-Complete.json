                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you very much for inviting me to the community hall for this brief presentation on music – or to be more specific, vinyl records and record players. Now, as I am sure many of you are aware, records have once again become very popular in many countries, and record sales are nearly at the point of overtaking CD sales – that figure is not the units sold, but the overall amount spent on this format. Of course, digital music from streaming services are still the major format most people use to listen to music, but the gap between digital music and records is closing.\n\nI’d like to start by talking about the history of records and recorded music. Some of you may be familiar with the name Thomas Edison. He is credited as having created the light bulb and other inventions, and is also recognised as the first person to have recorded music on to a disc.  These early music records were made from a range of materials, including hard rubber. However, there were some issues with the number of times a record could be played before it simply wore out, and the variable quality of manufacture meant that reproductions were not always very good copies of the original music.\n\nOver the years, styles of manufacture changed, as did the materials used. The first to replace the original rubber records used a substance known as shellac, mixed with wax and paper. It was found that this combination meant that the sound quality was better and the records themselves could be played many more times without a reduction in the sound quality. The public reaction to these new records was overwhelmingly positive, with sales increasing significantly in just a matter of months.\n\nMass production of this new shellac record first began in 1898 in Hanover, Germany, and the same formula was used to create records for over 50 years. However, despite their popularity, there was a drawback – the records needed to be handled carefully, as the shellac that was used meant that the record could easily break if it was dropped or bent. There was actually an alternative which was advertised and sold as ‘unbreakable’, but these records, usually made of celluloid - an early form of plastic – suffered from an exceptionally high level of background noise and were never as popular.\n\nHowever, in the late 1940s, there were radical changes in the production process as vinyl records became the new music standard. Vinyl records did not shatter when dropped and were available in a range of different colours, a new development from records that had previously been only black or brown. These new vinyl records become wildly popular, but this is not to say that they did not have their drawbacks. They could be damaged by incorrect storage, heat or even exposure to sunlight, but nonetheless, by the 1950s and beyond, the number of people who had a record player and spent money on records increased dramatically.\n\n<hr />\n\nNow I’m going to tell you a little about a common record player from around the 1970s. The example you can see here is actually from 1976, so has no digital displays or anything overly technical, although it was a very popular record player at the time.\n\nThe largest section of a record player is the plate – here you can see that that’s the large, circular section on which the record sits. Normally you will see a slip mat on <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q16: the record plate]</strong>, designed to hold the record in place. Right in the middle of the plate is the spindle, which keeps the record in the middle of the plate as it revolves. In the bottom left corner, you can see <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q17: the power light]</strong>, which in this example has a slightly raised, circular shape. This light simply indicates whether the turntable is plugged in.\n\nJust beside the power light are three buttons, the largest of which is to start or stop the player. The two smaller buttons to the right control the speed at which the record will spin. In older record players like this, the buttons have numbers which indicate the speed at which the record will turn. This is measured in revolutions, or ‘spins’, per minute, referred to as RPMs. The first of these buttons – the one closest to the large button – is for playing <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q18: 33]</strong> RPM records and the other one is for <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q19: 45]</strong> RPM records.\n\nNow moving over to the other side, we can see the volume slider, which of course controls how loud the record will sound. On the same side at the back you will also see one of the of the most important piece of the record player. Starting right at the back corner, you can see a larger weight – this is the counterweight, and this can be moved to balance the whole arm. Now that arm, technically referred to as the <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q20: tone arm]</strong>, ends with the cartridge. In a typical record player – even some of the more modern versions – this is the part that needs the most care and attention, and often needs to be replaced. The cartridge is where the needle is, and it is from this section (fade)"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\n\nGood morning everyone. Welcome to our third lecture in this series on contemporary concepts in science. Today we are going to examine some relatively new ideas which have entered the scientific lexicon. To begin with we’ll look at what has become known as the Goldilocks Effect or Principle.\n\nMost of you will be familiar with the fairy-tale of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” where <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q39: a]</strong> little girl strays into the bears’ house and samples their food and furniture. She tests each of the bear’s porridge, chairs and beds to find the one that suits her best, the one that is “<strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q31: just right]</strong>”. Well the concept of things being ‘just right’, of falling within certain optimal limits, neither too extreme nor too simple has been termed the Goldilocks effect  and it has crept into scientific language in a wide range of fields.\n\nOne of the earlier uses of the term was by ecologists seeking to explain a number of different phenomena. In 2008, Eric Berlow and his colleagues entitled a paper, <em>The “<strong>Goldilocks factor</strong>” in food webs</em>. In this work they use the concept to explain how stable food chains in natural environments come into being, in other words what determines who eats who. It was found that body size is strongly linked to this question, so that predators eat creatures which are smaller than them but not too small. Thus a shark would eat a seal but probably not bother with shrimp.  Another group led by Gabrielle Katz used the expression to explain why streams in Arizona which had variable water flows supported more species of plant life than those that were consistently wet or dry.\n\nEarth scientists have also been employing the phrase to describe the conditions that create a liveable planet. It has been theorised that the Earth hasn’t become an unendurably hot planet like Venus, nor a freezing cold one like Mars is partially due to the role of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, in the geological cycle. It has been known for some time that CO2 is absorbed by mountain ranges and other large land masses and that volcanoes emit CO2. More recently it has been discovered that new rock which is pushed up in the process of geological upheaval releases a large amount of CO2 also. Due to the Earth’s self-regulating cycle, it has been dubbed the Goldilocks planet. This has received some condemnation for ignoring the facts of current climate change, and by making it seem we can continue to pump out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nAstrobiologists have extended the concept into their search for other inhabitable planets, and other intelligent life forms. Planets that would qualify as Goldilocks planets would be not too big nor too small, they’<strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q36: d]</strong> be the right distance from their star for life to exist and they’d have water. That is, they would be “just right” to sustain life.  It should be noted though that some planets which fall into this category could also be ‘gas giants’ like Jupiter and would be uninhabitable due to their toxic gassy environments. NASA’s Kepler space observatory has the task of exploring our galaxy in order to discover other Goldilocks planets. Possibly 40 billion such planets could exist according to estimations based on the data received from Kepler.\n\nRecently psychologists at the University of Rochester have applied the term to observations of very young children’s attention behaviour. By measuring the eye movements of a group of 7 and 8 month old babies watching video animations of increasing complexity the researchers were able to gauge when the infants would stop watching a video.  The children would lose interest if the video was too simple, or too complex or surprising. Thus videos that captured the children’s attention were ‘just right’, the right mixture of <u>novelty</u> ( not boring or frightening) and <u>challenge</u> (not too familiar or too confusing). Steven Piantoadosi, one of the researchers, states that their findings have wider implications for other types of learning, where the ideal materials for learning should be ‘just right’, stimulating but not too difficult.\n\nNow whether the Goldilocks principle is truly a scientific law, or a description of a certain state or just a buzz word is still open to debate. However, it is becoming an increasing popular expression. Medical science has adopted it to refer to the optimal dose of a medication. Economics has jumped on the bandwagon with Goldilocks economies, Goldilocks markets, Goldilocks pricing and Goldilocks marketing, all of which set out the perfect factors for economic wellbeing. It has been used in TED talks by cultural commentators to describe the best balance of independence and closeness in personal relationships. Goldilocks theory is becoming ubiquitous, just google it, but for all that it may merely be post-hoc theorising. That is, tailoring a theory after the fact, where things are explained in a way that can’t be tested, particularly in the field of human behaviour.
