I've come to find out some information about the college's social activity programme.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, you are in the right place, please take a seat. How can I help you?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well, I'm quite new here and I'd like to join some activities, as a way of getting to know people. Can you tell me what is available in the next few weeks?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Sure, now we run trips every weekend, sometimes they are day trips and sometimes they run for the whole weekend, it really depends how far we have to travel. The next trip – that's Friday 8<sup>th </sup>June, is to the Gold Coast – we still have a couple of places left if you would be interested?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, please tell me more. How much does it cost?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well, it's a full weekend trip, so it is one of the more expensive. It costs $75 and that includes transport to and from the Gold Coast (we go by bus), accommodation, and <span id=\"q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">breakfast</span>. It's cheaper than you would be able to do in your own, as we get group discounts for the accommodation and some of the cost is subsidised by the college.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Where does the group stay?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">At a backpacker hostel in the centre of town. It's called Sunshine Retreat, and has great facilities including a <span id=\"q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">tennis court</span> and a swimming pool. There is a communal kitchen area, so you can either cook dinner at the hostel or go out to one of the restaurants in the local area – there's a lot of choice!</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">I haven't been to the Gold Coast before, but I hear there is a lot to do?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, too much to fit in to one weekend really! Two places that are popular with our students are the Animal Reserve and Cinema World.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">I think I'd be interested in the animal reserve is it expensive to get in?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well, no, it's actually quite cheap, we have a special rate and the cost is $8.50 per person. It's a fantastic place – it focuses on environmental protection and education. You get to see many <span id=\"q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">native</span> and endangered animals living in conditions similar to their natural habitat.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Okay, well yes, I'd like to book the Gold Coast trip please, and I'd like to go to the animal centre while I am there.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Okay well, I'll take your booking for the weekend trip now, but you need to tell the <span id=\"q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">tour guide</span> when you get on the bus which activities you are interested in. She'll collect details for the whole group and make arrangements on your behalf.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">I can pay in cash now – for the weekend trip I mean. Here you are.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">That's great. I'll just do you a receipt, be outside the library building no later than 5.15. to meet the bus, it leaves at 5.30pm sharp on <span id=\"q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Friday</span> evening(it takes around 2 hours to get to the Gold Coast from here, so you should be there not long after 7.30), You'll get back to the campus on Sunday at around 6pm.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">That's great, thanks very much, I really looking forward to it.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">So is there anything else I can help you with?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well, I was just wondering if you have any information on any of the other trips that will be happening soon?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, I can tell you about the trips we have arranged for the rest of the month. On the 16<sup>th</sup> June we have one day trip to the city which involves a Bridge Climb, the rest of the afternoon is free for <span id=\"q6\" data-question=\"6\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">shopping</span> and sight-seeing. There are just 20 places available now on that trip. <u>The bridge climb takes 2 1/2 hours in the morning</u>. It costs $105 and that includes the climb and the transportation</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">That sounds quite exciting – is it dangerous?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">No, the climb is organised by a professional company and all the climbers are given a safety precautions training session before going onto the bridge. Of course all protective clothing is provided and you get to see the most amazing views of the city.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Okay, I'll think about that one, what else is available?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">The weekend after that we have a full weekend trip to Frazer Island – it's a beautiful sand island with the most fantastic <span id=\"q7\" data-question=\"7\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">white beaches</span> and freshwater lakes. It's a camping trip and all the <span id=\"q8\" data-question=\"8\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">equipment</span> you need, you know, tents, sleeping bags and cooking equipment is provided. That runs from Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> and returns Sunday 24<sup>th</sup>.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Now that sounds really interesting – is there a tour of the island?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, groups travel around in four-wheel drive minibuses, there are 10 people in each bus and we expect to take 4 vehicles, so that's enough room for 40 people. Ocean Beach on the island is amazing- its 75 kilometres long!</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">How much does it cost?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">It's $150. Now the last trip for the month is a winery tour – that's on the 30<sup>th</sup> of June. The group goes by coach to the Botanical Gardens and visits 3 wineries for wine-tasting. There's a <span id=\"q9\" data-question=\"9\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">picnic</span> lunch in the Albert River Valley, really good quality food, by the way! The trip costs $<span id=\"q10\" data-question=\"10\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">80</span>.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Wow, they all sound so interesting. I think I'll go on my trip this weekend and see how it goes, then come back in to make another booking.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Advisor</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Sure, there is more information in this month's Student Gazette, here's a copy – take with you – and remember you can book here or if you are studying on the St James campus you can book at the information centre which is next to the student bookshop.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Student</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Thanks so much for your help.
