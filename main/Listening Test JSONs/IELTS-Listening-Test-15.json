Can you tell me how you plan to fund your tuition throughout the course?\r\n\r\nAnne: Yes, personal means. I have savings and my parents have also promised to contribute. I don't think I'll need any bank loans at this stage.\r\n\r\nAdmissions officer: Well finally, can you tell me how you learned about or courses here?\r\n\r\nAnne: Actually my cousin studied on the MBA course two years ago and she recommended it to me.\r\n\r\n<p>Admissions officer: Okay, well thank you for coming in today. I will pass your details on to our <span id=\"q10\" data-question=\"10\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q10</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">admissions department.</span> They will contact you this week with a formal application form and they usually invite MBA candidates for interview.</p>\r\n\r\nAnne: Okay, well thanks for you time.\r\n\r\nAdmissions officer: No problem.

        "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\r\n\r\n(A) I'd like to introduce our guest speaker Professor Louise Phillips from AIL International. She is responsible for researching changes in lifestyle and the consequent impact on buyer behaviour. Today she is going to talk about the impact of changes in attitudes to leisure time on sales of labour-saving equipment such as microwaves and \"white goods\" which are products such as washing machines, refrigerators and dish washers.\r\n\r\n<p>(B) Thank you very much. Thank you for coming today. I'll start by talking about lifestyle changes over recent years <span id=\"q11\" data-question=\"11\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q11</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">for women.</span></p> As we all know, the wife and mother of the family has traditionally been responsible for organising and completing household tasks for the family. However, particularly over the last decade or so, we have seen a greater number of women continuing to work after marriage and returning to work after having children. This has significantly reduced the amount of time available for household chores. <p>The result is that nowadays, the majority of people own and regularly use products such as <span id=\"q12\" data-question=\"12\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q12</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">dishwashers or microwaves.</span></p> The modern family often considers hours spent on cleaning and cooking as a waste of valuable time and generally we are all interested in finding ways of reducing the number of hours we need to devote to such tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile washing machines have long been thought of as necessities by families, nowadays, so too are microwaves and dishwashers. <p>These goods can drastically reduce the amount of time we need to spend running our home and increase the amount of time available not only to go to work, but to also spend on <span id=\"q13\" data-question=\"13\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q13</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">leisure pursuits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As society develops and we become richer, we put more value on our leisure time and our possessions. The richer a society, <span id=\"q14\" data-question=\"14\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q14</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">the more demanding</span> it becomes.</p> People are no longer happy to work long hours for little return. Expensive holidays, expensive clothes and cars all become more important the more materialistic the society we live in. <p>Acquiring \"things\" and joining the \"race of acquisition\" means that modern society spends a lot of time and money purchasing <span id=\"q15\" data-question=\"15\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q15</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">unnecessary goods.</span></p> <p><span id=\"q16\" data-question=\"16\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q16</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Although expensive and persuasive marketing techniques are partly responsible, the demand for such goods often comes from young professionals,</span> those with the money to endlessly upgrade things simply because a better model is made available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q17\" data-question=\"17\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q17</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Our obsession with the newest and best products available, while good for the economy, can also have a negative impact on the environment.</span></p> It is not appropriate to over-produce appliances and over-use electricity to keep these unnecessary appliances operating in our homes. We often forget about the damage we have done to and continue to do to the environment.\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q18\" data-question=\"18\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q18</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Others opposed to the overuse of appliances and technology also argue that from a social point of view, over-reliance on gadgets means that people are losing the ability to be creative.</span></p> Traditionally it was considered an enviable skill to prepare meals night after night for our families. Nowadays, women are more likely to gain approval from others for their success in their careers than their ability in the kitchen. Along with microwaves have come ready-cooked meals, pre-washed vegetables and our reliance on take-away food when we are too busy to cook it ourselves.\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q19\" data-question=\"19\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q19</span></span><span id=\"q20\" data-question=\"20\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q20</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">While there are obvious advantages and disadvantages to our increasingly active buying behaviour and changing wants and desires, it is likely that our desire to purchase labour saving items will continue , so it is therefore inevitable that production of such goods will increase.</span></p> We can only hope to educate ourselves and our children to buy goods we need, not just goods that are available, and always maintain an awareness of their environmental impact. In short, moderation is the most important word for the future.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for coming today and listening to what I have to say. That concludes my talk. I hope you have found it both interesting and informative. If you have any questions, I would be very glad to answer them……."

        "transcript": "<strong>Section 3</strong>\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I'm here with today with Helen Warner, who has been a vegetarian for many years and is going to talk a little about vegetarianism. Helen, the concept of vegetarianism seems to have interested a number of our listeners, who have sent in some questions. To begin, what made you want to become a vegetarian?\r\n\r\n<p>Helen: <span id=\"q21\" data-question=\"21\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q21</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Well, when I was sixteen, I had friends that were vegetarian and they introduced me to the idea.</span></p> My parents were typical of their generation, and ate meat at least three or four times a week, so I didn't really think about it too much until a few years later. It was while I was at university that I really thought about, and decided that it was unfair to eat meat when there are so many alternatives available.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Is there anything you miss about not eating meat?\r\n\r\n<p>Helen: Ummm. No, not really. As I said, there are so many substitutes available these days, perhaps the most important of which comes from the <span id=\"q22\" data-question=\"22\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q22</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">soya bean.</span></p> Soya is so versatile, and is the staple substitute for most vegetarians.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what about the nutritional value of vegetarian food? Isn't it true that there are some vitamins that you can't get from soya or vegetables alone. Surely people need these vitamins?\r\n\r\n<p>Helen: Yes, that's correct. But actually there is only one vital vitamin that is only present in meat – that's vitamin B12. Most vegetarians are aware of the implication of this and actually take B12 supplement in the form of tablets. Of course the way you cook vegetables is also very important in preserving vitamins. Many countries, particularly the UK, have a reputation for <span id=\"q23\" data-question=\"23\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q23</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">overcooking</span> vegetables.</p> Water soluble vitamins - you know, where the vitamins are dissolved into the water - are often lost. Vitamin C is a common example. However, this loss of vitamins can be avoided by micro waving or steaming vegetables, which is what I do whenever I cook. Some people don't want to change their cooking habits too much, so if you do boil them simply cut down on the cooking time.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So a vegetarian diet is fairly healthy then?\r\n\r\n<p>Helen: Oh yes. A lot of people believe that vegetarianism is <span id=\"q24\" data-question=\"24\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q24</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">unhealthy,</span> but that's not actually the case.</p> Vegetarians are actually considerably healthier than many meat eaters. Consider for a minute the health aspects of the incredible amount of meat this country and others like it consume. The statistics for beef eating, for example, are quite frightening. The world figure for beef consumption is slightly less than 11kg per person each year. <p>Yet in Europe, the average consumption is nearly double that at <span id=\"q25\" data-question=\"25\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q25</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">21 kilos</span> per person, and in the USA it is even worse, with the average person eating <span id=\"q26\" data-question=\"26\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q26</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">44kg</span> of beef every year.</p>\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So are you suggesting that people stop eating meat altogether and everyone adopts a vegetarian lifestyle?\r\n\r\n<p>Helen: No, not at all. Even in the healthiest diets there is still a place for meat, but it should be eaten in moderation. Many nutritionalists think of foods in terms of a pyramid, with the foods we can eat relatively freely at the bottom and the foods we should carefully restrict at the top. The majority of our diet should be composed of <span id=\"q27\" data-question=\"27\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q27</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">cereals,</span> which would go on the bottom row of the pyramid. In this category could also be included such things as rice and pasta. Next, a good diet is followed by a roughly equal amount of vegetables and fruit. I try to have at least two servings a day of fruit and vegetable whenever possible. In decreasing quantities, you can then eat <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q28</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">dairy</span> foods – eggs, cheese etc. Almost at the top of the food pyramid comes fish - carefully prepared of course, not dripping in oil or batter! – and <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q29</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">white meat.</span> Chicken, for example, is a comparatively healthy meat, but again, a lot of this comes down to preparation methods. Right at the top of the pyramid come the ingredients of far too many western meals – <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q30</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">red meat</span> and potatoes.</p> It is particularly in this area that I would suggest moderation.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well, thank you very much Helen. I'm sure that a lot of listeners are interested in your views. How could they find out more about the health benefits of vegetarian options?\r\n\r\nHelen: Well there are lots of websites and books on healthy eating and vegetarianism, but it is always important to remember to consult your doctor before making any radical changes to your diet or lifestyle."

        "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\r\n\r\nOver the past 50 years, there have been some radical changes in the medicine as it is known in the West. This is largely the result of vast improvements in technology, but also in the rising importance of 'alternative' treatments. I have with me today Matthew East, a registered osteopath and a supporter of alternative techniques in healthcare. Matthew, can you tell us more about osteopathy?\r\n\r\n<p>Well, perhaps the first thing I should say is that the term 'alternative' is actually a little misleading, as I am referring to approaches and attitudes to health that were in common use long before western medicine was established. I prefer the term <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q31</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">'natural'.</span></p> <p>Anyway, I'll begin by telling you a little about osteopathy. Basically, osteopathy is the manipulation of <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q32</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">muscles</span> in order to alleviate stresses and tensions that lead to pain.</p> <p>Now unlike western medicine, osteopathy considers <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q33</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">the whole body,</span> not just the affected area, and this is a very important principle of natural remedies. The whole body must be considered before a course of treatment can be decided upon.</p> You see, the aim of therapies like osteopathy is not only to repair the body, but also to get the body treating itself, and this does not come from treating the symptoms. <p>To give an example, I recently treated a two-month-old baby who was screaming all day and was even worse at night. The couple had taken the baby to their doctor, but the only advice they were given was that the baby 'would grow out of it'. However, the real problem stemmed from <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q34</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">a difficult birth</span> which had put pressure on their baby's neck.</p> After ten minutes of gentle manipulation the pressure was released and within 20 minutes, the baby was quiet and calm for the first time. <p>This was achieved without drugs or operations. Avoiding such <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q35</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">invasive</span> methods of treatment highlights another of the differences between western medicine and a more natural approach.</p> You see, western medicine often uses surgery in order to find a solution to problems that could have been addressed with simple remedies. A medical approach that looks closely at how essential an operation is before it is performed would offer patients a considerably less stressful method of treatment, not to mention the financial savings. <p>Natural remedies actually amount to less than <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q36</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">ten percent</span> of the cost of a western course of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q37</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">I'd like to mention the subject of surgery again a little later, but I would like to say at this point that there are those that claim that the benefits of osteopathy and herbal therapies are largely psychological, that they have not undergone the clinical trials that pharmaceuticals have. To answer that, you only need to look at the example I gave earlier, of the baby that stopped crying less than an hour after treatment but was obviously far too young to react because of purely psychological factors.</span></p> Another example can be seen in the successful use of acupuncture in the treatment of animals. In response to criticism regarding clinical trials, it is worth noting that the power of pharmaceutical companies is such that although some drugs fail the standards required of them, they are sometimes still prescribed by doctors.\r\n\r\nMoving on to another point, it should be stressed that natural remedies, in addition to having no side effects, can also be applied to any patient. Now I'm not suggesting that the same treatments are used indiscriminately. I'm referring to the fact that treatment is the same with natural therapies regardless of age, but very specific to the person. By this I mean that not only the general health of the patient needs to be considered, but also their habits, diet and lifestyle in order to build a complete picture.\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q38</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">However, I am not suggesting that we should reject western medicine entirely. In fact, there have been occasions when I have referred patients to their doctor as I felt that in those cases it was the most suitable course of action. There are many situations in which it is by far the best option.</span></p> <p>Take <span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q39</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">emergency surgery,</span> for example. Obviously more natural remedies do not provide the speed required in such cases. The best solution would therefore be an open-minded combination of the two forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, thank you very much Matthew. That was a very interesting insight into alternative, sorry natural, treatments. Next week we'll be inviting <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q40</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Dr Moore</span> onto the programme to argue his case as a doctor.</p> Until next week, then, goodbye."
