How may I help?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Oh hello, I have recently crashed my car and would like to know how to go about making a claim.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Certainly – I assume you have a policy with us?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Yes, I do. My policy number is NK 143?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Thanks. And can you tell me your full name please?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Sure it’s Jane Anne Freemont / John Andrew Freemont</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Is that F-R-E-E-M-O-U-N-T?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">No, not quite – there’s no U. It’s just F-R-E-E-M-O-N-T.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">OK, thanks. And your current address?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">It’s 14a High Road, Garlston.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">That’s great. The computer is just looking for your policy...Ah yes, here it is. I see that you have more than one vehicle insured with us. Which car was involved in the accident?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">It’s the Ford Escort; the other car is fine.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">OK, I can see that here. It’s a 1998 model, isn’t it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Yes, that’s the one. The registration number is ZK3772.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Thanks. Now, if you can describe the accident to me, I can make a note of it and start your claim.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Thanks. Well, all I did was reverse into the corner of my garage. My fault, but it has caused some damage to the back of the car.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Well, these things happen. If you can tell me what part of the back of the car is damaged, then I can make mark it on our claim forms.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">The back bumper has come off, and the passenger’s side lights have broken – the ones on the driver’s side are fine. The lock on the boot has also jammed, so I can’t open it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">I see. So the bumper may need to be replaced, and the lights have broken.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Yes, but only the lights on the passenger’s side.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Oh, OK. And did you say the boot is won’t close?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Actually, the problem is the boot won’t open. I think it’s bent so it seems stuck now.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">I’ll just make a note of that too, then.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">OK, so now have the basic details of the claim, we can start processing your application so you can get the car repaired and back on the road.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Great – I really need it as soon as possible because it’s the car I used for work.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">No problem – we aim to get our customers’ vehicles repaired and returned within 7 days wherever possible, but it sounds like the repairs to your vehicle should only take two days.  The next step is to take the car for a closer inspection.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Can I use my local garage?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Well, that depends – you can take your vehicle to any of our preferred service mechanics. We only authorise work done by garages that are on our preferred service list, so it depends whether the garage you have in mind is on that list.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">It’s Kane Automotive in Eldon Street – is that OK?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Just let me have a look... yes, they are on our list, so that’s no problem at all. Just take your car to them and ask them to prepare a quotation for the repairs. When they give you a written quotation, you should fax or post it to us as soon as possible. If our insurance assessors agree with the costs, we will contact Kane’s Automotive immediately to begin work on your car.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">And if your assessor says the costs are too high?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Insurance agent:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">Then you would need to take the vehicle to another garage to obtain a second quote. Don’t worry though – because Kane’s Automotive is on our list, we don’t expect there to be any problems.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"76\">Customer:</td>\n<td width=\"540\">That’s good. I will need my car back as soon as possible.

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\n‘The Gathering 2014’ was intended to be a definitive celebration of the culture and history of Scotland and what a success it has been! The two-day event on Saturday 25th and Sunday 26th July more than lived up to our expectations and proved to be the greatest international clan gathering the world has ever seen, and the largest Highland Games to have ever been held in Scotland.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Scottish culture – what is a clann? Well the original word clan - spelt C-L-A double-N – means ‘children’ in Scottish Gaelic language. Each clan was made up of a large group of people, almost like an extended family, all owing allegiance to a particular clan chief. A clan could be made up of groups of different families who could be genetically unrelated but who shared the common bond of looking to the clan chief as their head and their protector.\n\nHistorically, a clan was made up of everyone who lived on the chief's territory, or who lived on the territory of those who owed allegiance to the said chief. A chief could add to his clan by allowing in other new families, and also had the legal right to remove anyone who displeased him from his clan, including blood-related members of his own family. Often those living on a chief's lands would over time change their family name to the clan surname. Today, anyone who has the chief's surname is automatically considered to be a member of that chief's clan.\nThe Gathering 2014 was a unique event which gave the opportunity for Scots and those of Scottish heritage everywhere to celebrate, as well as providing an opportunity to thank the clan associations and Scottish societies from around the world for their role in keeping these traditions alive.\n\nThe planning for the Gathering 2014 began as far back as February 2012 and the event was set up to be a leading event of ‘Homecoming Scotland’ – which was a year-long government initiative aimed at encouraging those with a passion or connection with Scotland to return.\n\nFor many years, Scotland itself experienced a decline in the popularity of traditional Scottish Highland Games, and clan activity had virtually come to a complete standstill. However, the opposite was seen to be true in other countries, especially in The United States of America, where clan membership continued to exceed 100,000 and where over 300 Highland Games and festivals continued to be held annually. In neighbouring Canada, membership of the Clan Ross Association, established in 1960 has also continued to grow. Evidently, Scottish identity was still thought to be of great importance by Scottish people and those of Scottish ancestry now living abroad.\n\nPleasingly, over more recent times, there has been an overall strengthening of national identity within Scotland itself too, which has been wonderful to see. It is important now to maintain and grow the reawakened interest in Scottish culture. Indeed, a key concern of the Gathering 2014 has been to highlight and strengthen interest in Scottish culture amongst younger Scots – the people who will be crucial to maintaining pride, interest in and knowledge of the culture in years to come. There has been a strong emphasis on youth participation in the Gathering 2014 which was nurtured through an education programme put into place in local Scottish schools prior to the event on 25th and 26th July.\n\nThe weekend’s celebrations in Holyrood Park succeeded in uniting more than 47,000 clan members of all generations from at least 40 countries around the world. A truly amazing spectacle! 20,000 spectators also lined the Royal Mile - the popular collective name for a group of streets which form the main thoroughfare of Edinburgh's Old Town - to watch 8,000 people marching with their clan and the pipes and drums on Saturday evening.\n\nOrganisers are said to be ecstatic with the response and the weekend exceeded expectations. This was a truly international gathering and attendees can be pleased they made the effort to join the local community in becoming a part of history!"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 3</strong>\n\nBrian: It’s a pleasure to be able to show you around the wonderful city of Manchester. Contrary to many people’s belief we have more to offer than just an internationally renowned football team! Actually, we’re proud to be the home of two premier league football teams, as we are home to both Manchester United and Manchester City. Our sporting connections don’t end there - we were the proud hosts of the Commonwealth Games in 2002.\n\nFreya: is it true that Manchester is the third most visited city by tourists in the UK?\n\nBrian: Yes, it is. Manchester today is a respected centre for the arts, the media, higher education and commerce. All these factors contributed to Manchester polling as the second city of the United Kingdom back in 2002.\n\nMore recently, in 2006, the city was voted as the best place in the UK to locate a business in a survey involving business leaders. In 2007, terms of the economy we were pinpointed as the fastest growing city in the UK, so we have a lot to be proud of and grateful for.\n\nFreya: Would you say that Manchester’s importance economically and as a centre for commerce began in the time of the industrial revolution? Doesn’t the city have a significant historical link to the textile industry and cotton? Even nowadays in countries such as South Africa the term ‘Manchester’ is used to refer to household linen – you know, sheets, pillow cases, towels and things.\n\nBrian: Yes, you are absolutely right. During the industrial revolution, Manchester was the UK’s most productive cotton processing centre and most cotton spinning took place in the surrounding towns of South Lancashire and North Cheshire. Do you know what cotton spinning is, by the way? It’s the process of turning the raw material into usable thread for sewing.\n\nThe cotton industry was really only the beginning too, very quickly many associated industries sprung up around the city. By 1835, Manchester was considered to be the first and greatest industrial city in the world.\n\nFreya: Associated industries? I’m not sure I follow you. Do you mean the retail industry– to sell the products made from the cotton and suchlike?\n\nBrian: Well, yes. But that was only part of it. Manchester did become the world’s biggest market place for cotton goods, but all of these other industries developed too. For example, there was opportunity for huge growth in engineering in the area, because companies were needed that could make and supply machinery and processing equipment for the cotton industry. The chemical industry developed too, initially due to the need for bleaches and dyes to use on the cotton products.\n\nFreya: Of course, because Manchester was such a significant commercial centre, it would have needed business services to develop too I imagine? Such as banking and insurance I mean.\n\nBrian: Absolutely. Those business services were very important. Of course distribution and transport channels also had to cope with the massive increase in business activity and the huge growth in the population too.\n\nManchester was one of the first two cities in the world to be connected by the first intercity passenger railway. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened on 15th of September 1830 and it was the first time all the trains on a line, which were hauled for most of the distance solely by steam locomotives, were timetabled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFreya: So the line ran between the two north west England cities of Liverpool and Manchester in North West England? I was reading about it in an information guide. It said that the line was built primarily to allow faster transport of raw materials and finished goods between the cotton mills in Manchester and the city of Liverpool.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBrian: Correct. The connection to Liverpool was important, you see, because Liverpool had a port which allowed for onward shipping of products from Manchester to elsewhere in the world. Of course, in the latter end of the 1880s, Manchester itself achieved direct access to the sea thanks to the construction of the Manchester ship canal.\n\nFreya: So a city that is so far from the coast, managed to get access to the sea?\n\nBrian: yes, that’s right. The Manchester Ship canal is a 36 mile (or 58 kilometer) long river navigation which connects the city to the sea.\n\nFreya: That must have been an enormous engineering project, especially at the time.\n\nBrian: yes, it was. It was built between 1887 and 1894 and was then the largest navigation canal in the world. It cost around 15 million pounds to build – by today’s currency that would translate to around 1.22 billion pounds!\n\nIt could accommodate a range of different ships and liners, but it’s not large enough for many of the types of modern vessels used today.\n\nFreya: Is it still used for shipping commercially today?\n\nBrian: Yes, it still carries about six million tonnes of freight each year. It operated privately now and it’s nowhere near as significant in shipping terms as it used to be. Right, now, let’s move on to discuss some of the cities architecture…"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4\n</strong>\n\n<strong>Man:  </strong>Good morning, students.  Today, we’re going to continue our examination of indigenous cultures, looking at some of the common threads that bind them together, interestingly, often across continents…, and today, we’ll be looking at a specific form of water transport, namely, dugouts, canoes, or sometimes what are known as logboats, that is, a boat constructed mainly from a single log.  It’s quite amazing, actually, as we’ll see, the similarities that exist across the cultures, and, indeed, through the centuries.\n\nIt is interesting to note that archaeological evidence of manmade boats dates back to more than10,000 years ago, and yet, in parts of Thailand and Myanmar, some local tribes still construct traditional dugout canoes and use them today for transport, commercial operations, such as transporting merchandise, and fishing and hunting.\n\nSo, what is a dugout canoe?  Well, as described earlier, a dugout canoe, or logboat, is exactly as its name implies, a canoe dug out from a carefully selected log to suit the purposes of its intent.  The construction of the dugout is remarkably similar when examining the different cultures.  The first criterion is to choose a tree, soon to become a log of the appropriate size and dimensions.  Depending on the continent and environment, different types of trees, or wood, were selected through the years and the development of the dugout, and the different strengths and durabilities were known to the locals, often according to the density of the wood.  Once the correct length was decided, the log was then shaped with pointed ends to help with propulsion through the water, and to reduce friction at the rear, and the log was stripped of branches and bark.  Going back 8000 years, metal tools were not used, so, one of the methods used to hollow out the log, after the top third of the length was removed, was using a series of small fires carefully monitored by the builders, who then removed the burnt wood and ash using primitive tools.  It was important during the construction to ensure that enough wood was taken from the log to ensure that the canoe would be light enough in weight and buoyancy, but would still be robust and strong enough to hold the sailors, and any cargo they might be carrying.  After the log, now soon to be a sea-going canoe, was hollowed out, the insides of the log were smoothed using the tools of the day, such as what is known as an adze, a small ax-like implement used to smooth and level rough surfaces.  As well, tree sap was used to smooth, patch over and to help adhere extra parts, such as rudimentary seats and to help with outrigger and sail design.  The earlier dugouts followed the shape of the tree, or log, keeping a round bottom, but as primitive technology advanced, innovations were seized on and one example is that it was discovered that the log could be heated, and steamed, and thus shaped to some degree, with a wider beam and flatter bottom, thus allowing more sailors to be carried.\n\nOne interesting feature that has been noted that a number of indigenous cultures have developed was the use of an outrigger, that is, a log that is fixed parallel to the main hull by long, often curved poles, and in some cases, two outriggers were affixed, one on each side, thus increasing stability, and allowing for deep-sea voyages of some distances, sometimes reaching up to 500 kilometres.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some particular dugouts specific to some cultures.  Perhaps the oldest known dugout is known as the Pesse Canoe, which was discovered in the Netherlands, and has been carbon-dated to more than 8000 years BC.  Other European dugouts have been uncovered in Germany dating back more than 7000 years and one was 12 metres in length, which, makes it the longest old European dugout.  A dugout located in Ireland in 1902 was measured at over 15 metres and dated back some 4000 years, and was one of the first to have a series of holes in a pattern, which indicated that it may have been one of the first to incorporate an outrigger design.\n\nIn Africa, in particular, Nigeria, evidence shows that the oldest known vessel is an 8000-year-old dugout known as the Dufuna Canoe, which is also recognized as the third-oldest in the world.  African dugouts were used for transport across the deep lakes and up and down rivers and across swamps.  Teak, a native hardwood, was the most common wood used for the construction of dugouts, and because much of Africa was colonized by the French, the word ‘pirogue’ is the local term for dugout canoe.\n\nIn North America, most of the ocean-going dugout canoe activity was centered in the Pacific North-West, that is, British Columbia in Canada, on the west coast, and Washington state in the United States.  The famous birch-bark canoe of the North American Indian was only for inland lake and river travel, but the Pacific North-West dugouts were hollowed out of huge cedar and fir logs, often decorated with carvings and indigenous designs, perhaps originating from their famous totem pole construction.  The Indian tribes constructed large ocean-going canoes, sometimes up to 20 metres in length, carrying up to 60 or 70 paddlers, and travelling long distances.  In 1978, an anthropology crew in Canada made the nearly seven thousand five hundred kilometer crossing from Canada to Hawaii in a constructed dugout canoe to prove that earlier ocean-going tribes were capable of such a crossing.\n\nIn New Zealand and the South Pacific Islands, the indigenous peoples were well-known for the construction of their deep-sea crafts, known in New Zealand as ‘waka’ with their distinctive outriggers for stability and increased steering.  Like the North American craft, these canoes were capable of carrying up to 80 sailors, or warriors, if the need dictated, and again there is anthropological evidence that possibly the ocean-crossing vessels came from islands in the northern parts of the Pacific, settling in the South Pacific islands and New Zealand.  The New Zealand waka was further developed by extending the basic canoe with the addition of other parts, lashed and tied together with a rope fashioned from the native flax plant.  As well, dugout canoes from Hawaii and the South Pacific were noted for their additional features, the main one being a sail which aided in propulsion.\n\nThe basic dugout canoe has had a wide-ranging impact on indigenous culture.  As mentioned earlier, the canoe served as a primary means of transport, both domestically, and in some cultures, crossing oceans and seas to explore, settle or even combat with different groups.  As well, basic forms of sustenance such as hunting and fishing were facilitated with the dugout canoe, and, as trading emerged, commerce was given a boost as the larger dugouts were able to move merchandise and goods great distances and… (fade)"
