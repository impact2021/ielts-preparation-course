                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\nGood evening. My name is Dr James Philipps, and I have been invited here today to discuss my research and to tell you a little more about my new book, <strong>Silver Lining</strong>, which has just been published by Longman Press. This book covers one of my biggest interests – whether there are in fact aliens from other planets that have visited Earth in unidentified flying objects, or UFOs as they are more commonly known.\n\nI’d like to start with a quick introduction – over the last 12 years I have become increasingly interested in the subject of UFOs, and this book is a compilation of all the <strong>alien sightings</strong> I have heard about. Now, I understand that many people doubt whether visitors from other planets even exist, and I admit that until I did a lot of extensive research, I had my doubts, but I am now convinced that there is life on other planets and that aliens have indeed come to our planet.\n\nThe television and the media has given us all a mental picture of an alien space craft - a silver ship with bright lights that moves at very high speed. However, what I was somewhat shocked to discover was that in all the eyewitness accounts I heard, people gave very <strong>precise and detailed descriptions that varied only slightly. Reports from America, Europe, Asia -  in fact, all over the world - share a significant number of similarities.</strong>\n\nNow, my aim in writing this book was to gather together all the information available and make a kind of reference guide. There are statements from a vast number of different people, ranging from ordinary citizens to people quite high up in the government, accompanied with a lot of photographs and other evidence. I have deliberately avoided any personal opinions or interpretations, and as such the book is <strong>not presenting a subjective point of view, but the facts as they are currently known.</strong>\n\nMany people have drawn attention to the fact that the majority of UFO sightings have occurred in America, and I think that is something I should talk about. The popularity of science fiction programs in America could lead you to suspect that these sightings are nothing more than an overactive imagination. However, I have found there are a number of other factors that determine UFO sightings. In northern Europe, the number of reports is very low, whereas in southern Europe, where there is more open space, less light pollution and generally clearer skies, the number of sightings increases. Now when you consider <strong>the vast open areas of America</strong>, there is an argument that UFOs are simply easier to see in certain geographical and climatic situations .\n\n<hr />\n\nMy book also talks about a place in America which has often been in the media, commonly referred to as <strong>Area 51</strong> and is in fact a military base in New Mexico. In 1947, this previously relatively unknown base became internationally famous when a man called <strong>MacBrazel</strong> - that's spelt MACBRAZEL - claimed to have found pieces of an alien spacecraft on his farm in Roswell. Now many people believe that this was true and that the government of the time took the debris to a secure location.\n\nAcademics and government officials have claimed that what MacBrazel actually saw were pieces of a <strong>high-altitude </strong>weather balloon that had disintegrated. Unfortunately, the lack of information combined with the large number of possible alternate theories means, that no useful scientific conclusion can be drawn.\n\nMany people have asked me if I discuss the question of alien abduction in my book and I should tell you know that I don't really cover that. You see I was looking to present facts from which people could draw their own conclusions, but with these reported abductions, I found them to be very real unreliable.\n\nThe final chapter of my book deals with some of the many scientific theories that could be argued support the idea that we have already been visited by aliens. The Great Pyramids of Egpyt, Stonehenge in the UK and many other archaeological areas certainly raise questions, but perhaps the most interesting new development has come from Scotland, where some recently discovered cave paintings show images very close to those described by eye witnesses in recent years.\n\nWell thank you very much for your time. Before we finish, I would just like to add that my books is available at all leading book stores priced at £19.99."

Talking behind someone’s back is an example of a passive aggressive trait.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student 1:</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Right and so you are looking at all of this in the context of customer service?

There’s a lot of skills that customer service representatives can use if someone is behaving angrily. A really good one I was reading about was to keep using the person’s name – you know, calmly and politely, the theory being that <span class=\"answers\">(Q28/29/30) it is more difficult for a person to treat another person rudely if the conversation is more personalised.</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student 1:</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Psychology is interesting isn’t it? I remember our lecturer saying that often <span class=\"answers\">(Q28/29/30) if a customer feels they are being listened to and respected that they are more likely to feel that they have had a good experience with a company</span> – even if they didn’t actually get the product that they wanted. Being given something by someone who has poor customer service skills can be more irritating than being told politely that you’ll have to come back the next day!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student 2:</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\"><span class=\"answers\">(Q28/29/30) Giving clients choices is a useful approach too.</span> You know if you have a complaint about a faulty product and there are none in stock you might ask if they would like a refund or would prefer to wait for a replacement. Giving people choices gives them a feeling of worth and control and reduces the likelihood of them becoming irritable with the wait for the replacement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student 1:</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">True, very true. Well I’m going to the library to work on my assignment this afternoon.... why don’t you come with me?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Student 2:</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay, let’s go now.

Norfolk Island and two neighbouring islands – Phillip Island and Nepean Island which form one of Australia’s external territories.\n\n<span class=\"answers\">(Q31) Although a territory of Australia, Norfolk island has its own flag</span>, on which can be seen a green pine tree – this being representative of an evergreen tree native to Norfolk island itself. <span class=\"answers\">(Q32) Today, the island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance.</span> The island is subject to separate immigration controls to the rest of Australia and<span class=\"answers\"> (Q33) a certain amount of controversy surrounds its territory status to this day </span>– some islanders insisting that in fact the island had been granted independence by Queen Victoria in the 1800s.\n\nBefore the Europeans arrived, Norfolk Island <span class=\"answers\">was first settled by East Polynesian seafarers either from the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand or from the North Island of New Zealand. They arrived in the (Q34) fourteenth or fifteenth century</span>, and inhabited the island for several generations before they disappeared – to this day the reasons for their demise remain a mystery.\n\nCaptain James Cook, was the first European to sight the island which he did in 1774, on his second voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Resolution.\n<span class=\"answers\">(Q35) The abundance of trees – as depicted on the island’s flag -was one of the major points of interest to be discovered by Northern Hemisphere explorers. </span>\n\nCook christened the island in honour of the <span class=\"answers\">(Q36) Duchess of Norfolk back in the UK – as it turned out, one year after the Duchess had actually died</span>; since Cook had set out from England in 1772, he was unaware of her death which had already occurred in May 1773.\n\nOn Tuesday 11 October 1774, for the first time, Cook went on shore to Norfolk Island and is said to have been impressed with the tall straight trees and New Zealand flax plants. He took samples back to the United Kingdom and reported on their potential uses for the Royal Navy. At that time, finding new sources of flax – which was used for ship sails and timber for ship masts – was crucially important to allow the United Kingdom to continue its control of ocean going activities. Captain Cook reported that <span class=\"answers\">(Q37) Norfolk Island had the second most plentiful supply of wood and mast timber in the south seas after New Zealand.</span>\n\n<span class=\"answers\">What made Norfolk island a particularly attractive prospect to the British in conjunction with its plentiful supply of trees and flax was its lack of a (Q38) native population</span>; there was therefore no one present to oppose colonisation unlike in New Zealand where opposition was a certainty from the native Maori population. Since however, the island was so small, (it has an area of 34.6 km2) the decision was taken for a dual colonization alongside New South Wales – the connection to Australia being therefore established.\n\nToday, most Islanders are of either European-only or combined European-Tahitian ancestry, being descendants of the Bounty mutineers as well as more recent arrivals from Australia and New Zealand.<span class=\"answers\">(Q39) </span><span class=\"answers\">About half of the islanders can trace their roots back to Pitcairn Island</span>.\n\nThe population of Norfolk Island was estimated in July 2003 to be 1,853, 20.2% of the population were 14 years and under, 63.9% were 15 to 64 years and 15.9% were 65 years and over. Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk, which is in essence a blend of 1700s English and Tahitian. The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons; however, there are efforts to keep it alive through published dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents.\n\nEmigration is growing as many Islanders choose to move to Australia or New Zealand. There is only one school on the island which provides education to Australian Year 12. However, any student wishing to go on to university or another form of tertiary study must travel overseas as no such institutions exist on the island. <span class=\"answers\">(Q40) Many skilled workers now also elect to move overseas to pursue increased economic opportunities in bigger centres.</span>\n\nNowadays, the main economy of the island is tourism and a ban on the import of fruit and vegetables helps to ensure that agriculture remains fairly robust."
