There are a couple of good schools in Northbridge, and also in Meadowvale, which is the next suburb.  What kind of house are you looking for?\n\n<strong>M:   </strong>Well, three bedrooms, I want to set up an office in the third bedroom.  I do a lot of work from home you see.\n\n<strong>W:   </strong>Ok.\n\n<strong>M:   </strong>Oh, and a garage…, a 2-car garage, if possible.\n\n<strong>W:   </strong>Alright.  I’ll type that into the computer and see what we have.  Do you have any other requirements?\n\n<strong>M:   </strong>Well, of course we want a kitchen and living area, but we would also like two bathrooms if possible. We would also like a garden, but it would have to have a fence.\n\n<strong>W:   </strong>Right, I’ve got that. Now, do you have any pets…?\n\n<strong>M:   </strong>No, no we don’t.\n\n<strong>W:   </strong>That’s good – some landlords don’t allow pets in the house. Anything else?\n\n<strong>M:   </strong>Well, we’re new to this city, so I don’t know a lot about Northbridge.

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\nGood morning everyone. I would first like to welcome you to the Glengarret distillery, where some of the world’s finest whisky is produced all from local ingredients. Later on in the tour there will be a chance to sample some of our range of whiskies, but we’ll begin by looking at the history of our distillery.\n\nFor many people, Scotland is perhaps most famous for its whiskies. The word ‘whisky’ actually came from a Gaelic word which, when translated, means ‘Water of Life’. A combination of traditional methods and the soft spring water used in the production of traditional Scotch whisky has made it a world favourite; in fact, exports of whisky in 2007 accounted for 2.5 billion pounds – that’s nearly 80 pounds a second!  There are two main types of whisky; single malt or blended. Single malt whisky, as the name implies, uses only one type of grain in its production, and is completed as a single process. Blended whisky, on the other hand, can use a variety of different single malt whiskies and combine them. Many people believe the taste of a single malt whisky to be much finer than a blend, despite the fact that more blended whisky is sold than single malts.\n\nThe first recorded reference to whisky dates as far back as 1494, but since that time many refinements have been made to the process of making whisky. Using the term ‘Scotch’ to refer to whisky has a very specific meaning. It is internationally protected, and only whiskies made in Scotland, using largely local ingredients, can be classified as ‘Scotch’. Despite strict regulations about using the term ‘Scotch whisky’, it is legally acceptable to use barley from any part of the world to create a Scotch whisky, but here at Glengarret we only use local barley. It is more expensive than importing it from other countries, but it gives our product the unique taste for which it is world famous.\n\nThis region has been producing whisky since the 1750s, although Glengarret has been operating for just over 200 hundred years, having been started in 1807 by three brothers. Apart from the introduction of more modernised equipment, the whisky process here at Glengarret has changed only a little since those times. The company remains small, employing fewer than 25 people, with most of our staff being the third or even fourth generation of their family to work in the distillery.\n\nNow we will move on to how our whiskies are made and where we get our 100% natural ingredients from. I would like to ask you to keep your questions until the end of this part of the tour – there will be plenty of time for questions later on. Now if you’d all like to follow me, we’ll start the tour.\n\nOne of the most important ingredients in whisky is barley. The barley being used for the production of whisky is carefully selected as it will largely determine the quality of the whisky when it is ready for sale. The first step towards making the whisky is when the barley is ‘malted’. This process takes a few days, during which time the barley is spread out on the malting room floor as you can see here.\n\nAfter about three days, this is then dried out. The malted barley is laid on racks inside the kiln, a special furnace used for drying, and it is here that a lot of the taste of a whisky is determined. Here at Glengarret, we use peat – a type of soil rich in vegetation that gives the whisky a very smoky flavour. The dried malt is then taken to the dressing room, where the pure malt is separated from unwanted material and other debris. From the dressing room, the malt is then sent to the mill to be ground down into a coarse flour called grist. The grist is then fed into the mash tun, along with hot water, where it is stirred for some hours. This process is repeated three times. The remaining product is then put into wash backs, and yeast is added to start the fermentation process. This is then distilled, before being put into oak casks to mature. Some of our older whiskies may take up to 18 years to mature properly.\n\nOK, this is the end of this part of our tour. If anyone has questions, then please....\n\n&nbsp;"

Now, I think I remember that you were going to talk about birds, is that right?\n\nJake: Yes, that’s right – I’m going to talk about a particular type of bird - the gannet.\n\nPG: Oh yes.  Now, we last discussed this… what, two weeks ago?  …and we went over the research you had done on gannets, and I thought it was quite impressive, so now I just want to see what you have in the way of a presentation.  How are you planning to start the presentation?\n\nJ:   Well, I’ll begin with an overview of gannets in general, but I will be mainly discussing the Southern Pacific gannet - the one that breeds in Australia and New Zealand, as well as some other island nations.\n\nPG:   How much detail will you go into about the bird?\n\nJ:   Well, Not too much, but I will give some background information about them. Just points I think will be interesting, like their almost 2-metre wing span, and how they live in large colonies, although some live and feed on their own, as well.  They live on these large rocky coastal outposts, often enduring high winds. It can be quite a hard life for these birds. Following that, I’m going to move on to the nesting and breeding habits of the bird…\n\nPG: That sounds good. How are you going to present that?\n\nJ:   Well, I have videos and a PowerPoint presentation, and I will show images of both the bird and their nesting sites, and the video will give more information on how remote and desolate some of their nesting sites are.  The PowerPoint will also show the breeding and raising of the young, which is quite a…\n\nPG:   Yes, it’s quite remarkable how they breed, lay their eggs, and raise their chicks through the first year.\n\nJ:  Yes it is  – but I won’t have time to go through the entire first year of a chick’s life. Also, I have a number of handouts to go with the video, which will give a lot of statistical information on the birds’ breeding habits.\n\nPG:   Good, good. Can I see one of the handouts?\n\nJ:   Yes, certainly.  Uhh…, here it is.  It has a small map on it, although the map doesn’t give specific breeding site information. It focuses more on the general area where the breeding sites are in New Zealand, and then to where we believe they migrate to in Australia, although we don’t really know that this is where they go - surprisingly little is actually known about what happens when they leave New Zealand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Before you continue, you have some time to look at questions 26 – 30.     * pause *</em>\n\n<em>Now, listen carefully, and answer questions 26 – 30.  </em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPG:   This is all looking good, and I think you have a good sense of what I’m looking for in a presentation.  Now, let’s look at how this fits in with your overall study.  As you know, the presentation is going to make up 25% of this semester’s mark.\n\nJ:   Yes, I know that this is part of the final grade, so I want to do well!  I am also thinking of having a question and answer session at the end of the presentation…\n\nPG:   You certainly can, but keep in mind that this does not go toward your final mark.\n\nJ:   I know, but it will really give me an opportunity to get right into some of the aspects of what I’m trying to say… provided, of course, the others ask me some questions!  (laughs)\n\nPG:   Oh, I’m sure they will!\n\nJ:   And then, after I have played the video, I thought I’d ask the others some questions, just to make sure they’re understood everything.\n\nPG:   Well, you should make sure the video you show is clear and easy to follow, but it should also be interesting as this is another aspect you will be graded on for your final result. Now, what have you got in the way of acknowledging all your research and the information you’re presenting?  I’d like to see something along the lines of a bibliography or some kind of list of all your resources…\n\nJ:   Oh, yes, I have a full bibliography. Here is a copy.\n\nPG:   I don’t need it now.  I just wanted to make sure you have something as I will ask you for it after your presentation. As you know, I will be collecting all of the handouts after your presentation because they will go towards your grade too, so make sure they are well presented!\n\nJ:   Ok, I’ll keep that in mind.\n\nPG:   Now, I’d like to know how you’re going to wrap everything up.  What do you have in the way of a summary for the end of your presentation?\n\nJ:   Well, I’m going to finish by talking about some of the statistics - whether the population is increasing or decreasing, the number of undisturbed nesting ground grounds, that sort of thing.\n\nPG:   Ok, that sounds good.  Do you have any specific conclusions that you’ve come up with?\n\nJ:   No, you’ve told us before that with this kind of research, we have to be careful of drawing conclusions, especially when everything is so changeable, and the scientific evidence is… well, not exactly inconclusive, but open to interpretation….  You’ve stated that on a number of occasions.\n\nPG:   That is correct, and I’m glad you’ve taken it on board.  Let’s see what you have in the way of a conclusion.\n\nJ:   Well, here.  Here are some comments that I….   (fade)"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\n\nThe ‘brain drain’ refers to the situation that occurs due to large-scale emigration of educated or technically skilled individuals to other countries which has a negative impact upon the country they are choosing to leave. Usually this migration is prompted by a desire to escape conflict, a country plagued with health risks or political instability, but may also simply be inspired by a desire to improve one’s economic opportunities.\nBrain drain is usually regarded as having an economic cost to the country being left behind, since emigrants are calculated to take with them the fraction of value of their training sponsored by the government and there is an economic cost involved in finding skilled replacements to meet market needs. The term ‘brain drain’ was first used to describe the emigration of scientists and technologists to North America from post-war Europe.\nBrain drains are commonly experienced by developing nations where harsh or troubled living situations encourage nationals to wish to leave for brighter, healthier and safer futures. However, this type of migration can also be seen in seemingly developed and relatively comfortable economies but where people prefer to move to neighbouring countries perceived to have on offer even better, brighter opportunities. An example of the latter is the situation experienced by Canada with migration patterns to the United States of America.\nAs early as the 1860s, a trend towards preference for life in the United States was observed by Canadian administration when it was noted that the majority of immigrants arriving at Québec were en route to destinations in the United States and had no intention of remaining in Canada. A government agent at Quebec, Alexander C. Buchanan, suggested that prospective emigrants should be offered free land to encourage them to want to remain in Canada.\n\nIn the 1920s, it was observed that over 20% of university graduating classes in engineering and science were emigrating to the United States. But the percentage of technically trained Canadians leaving the country dropped from 27% in 1927 to under 10% in 1951 and 5% in 1967. Even so, between 1960 and 1979 over 17,000 engineers and scientists emigrated to the United States.\n\nToday, there is still a brain drain in existence from Canada to the United States, especially in specific sectors. These include the finance, information technology, aerospace, health care and entertainment industries. This migration preference is put down to higher wages and lower income taxes in the U.S. Research indicates that engineers and scientists are also attracted to America by the greater diversity of jobs in the United States and a perceived lack of research funding in Canada.\n\nThe United States itself is fortunate and rather unique in that it does not necessarily experience a large-scale brain drain to other countries since it has remained for many decades the destination of choice and perceived land of opportunity for many skilled migrants migrating from other parts of the world. The United States, however, does experience unevenness of distribution of its skilled worker population. A study conducted at the beginning of the 21st Century showed a definite preference for migration by young, skilled workers towards the West Coast and Southeast of America.\n\nOver recent years the United States of America, like other countries, has found it impossible to avoid rural depopulation – the movement of skilled workers from the countryside to urban and suburban areas which has negatively affected the economies of rural communities across the country.\n\nThe situation that occurs when many trained and skilled migrants choose to move to another country is called a brain gain. Particularly as birth rates tend to decline in developed nations, it is crucial for governments to attract individuals who are able to add value to that country’s economy and skills pool. In 2000, at a Canadian symposium, the relationship of native skilled workers choosing to leave the country and replacement by their immigrant counterparts who wished to migrate to Canada was discussed. This simultaneous but converse relationship is sometimes referred to as a ‘brain transplant’.\n\nOver recent years, Canada, along with several other developed nations has been proactive in encouraging interest from migrants able to contribute positively to the country, its economy and community. Canada has a thriving economy – one of the top 10 in the world - which is centred on the vast array of natural energy resources and mineral reserves, including Oil, Gas, Gold, Nickel and Lead. The country also possesses strong aeronautics, automobile and space industries.\n\nAccording to recent statistics and reports, the popularity of moving to a smaller Canadian community has increased amongst migrants. One of the major appeals being that trends show immigrants in smaller areas are more likely to earn equal income to the Canadian-born population much faster than those who decide to make new lives in larger metropolitan areas. Over recent time, the smaller Canadian communities have begun to work proactively to develop their own immigration strategies, to attract and encourage newcomers to their own particular part of the country."
