How can I help you?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">customer</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Hi, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to find out more about the winter specials you are advertising at the moment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">hotel receptionist</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Okay, well we’re offering weekly deals and long weekend specials at the moment. Which are you interested in ?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">customer</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Well, I’m not too sure at the moment. Can you tell me a little about both?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">hotel receptionist</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Yes, of course. The long weekend specials run from Thursday to Sunday or from Friday to Monday. You need to book for a minimum of three nights. For the weekly packages you receive a 5% discount, free parking at any London airport if you choose to fly here and pick up from our local airport.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">customer</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Oh right. I don’t think we’ll fly - we’re planning to stay somewhere on the way for a night or two to break up the journey as we’re planning on coming by car. What prices do the rooms work out to be for the three night package?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">hotel receptionist</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">It depends if you would like to book for the room only, room with breakfast, room with breakfast and dinner, or for the room with breakfast each day and dinner first night only – there are four options you see. And of course it also depends on how many people you would you be booking for.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">customer</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"80%\">Just two of us. We’d like to arrive on Thursday 17th and check out on Sunday 20th please.

It’s great that you could join us here. Before we start on a brief tour around the site, I’d just like to have a few minutes to tell you a little bit about the sanctuary itself, as well as some of the work that we do here…\n\nThe land on which the sanctuary now stands was gifted to a charitable trust in 1994, and was established as a wildlife sanctuary nearly ten years later, in 2002. While the sanctuary had originally operated with a primarily educational focus, this changed soon afterward and two years later, in 2004, our main role became involved with conservation first and foremost.\n\nAs far as opening hours are concerned, the sanctuary is open to the general public on both Saturdays and Sundays with Mondays being a day off for our staff. Having said that, we also close two hours earlier than usual on Thursdays, at three p.m., and are operating until five p.m. on all other business days.\n\nAs your guide, I should also mention that the sanctuary and the charity which operates it do offer the opportunity to members of the public to join our conservation club. Membership includes a number of discounts at our gift shop, special passes and a free copy of our monthly newsletter outlining all of our recent conservation efforts. If you are interested in finding out more about it and possibly joining our conservation club, please remember to ask at the front desk before you leave today.\n\nLastly, for the teachers and students among you, I would like to let you know that we do offer special tours for classes ranging from primary to secondary level. You just need to arrange these by booking at least a few weeks in advance.\n\nGuide: Now, as I lead you outside of the entrance building to the kiwi house, I must remind you that these are very shy nocturnal creatures so please do not use your cameras or mobiles with the flash function to take pictures inside the enclosure! Talking is fine, and there is absolutely no problem with any of you having a snack or drink inside the kiwi house, although I must ask you to speak very quietly, as shouting is likely to disturb the animals\n\nGuide: Right, here we are outside the kiwi house… I’d just like to say a few quick words about some of the conservation work that we do here at the Queenstown Wildlife Sanctuary… this work is part of what we call the conservation cycle. This process really begins for us when an animal is brought to the sanctuary. Initially the animals are assessed for any injuries so that we can decide what type of care they may require. Over the next twelve to twenty-four weeks or so the animals are cared for and gradually nursed back to health. After we have looked after them for between six months and one year, the individual animals are generally released, so that they can live in their natural environment again… Now, if you’d all like to just follow me…"

How are your classes going this semester?\n\nROBERT:   Good, on the whole. I’ve never really had any problems with mathematics… or chemistry either, for that matter. I’m finding my economics course a bit of a struggle though.\n\nFIONA:      I see. Well, I don’t envy you! You must be spending an awful lot of time in the library. I’m glad that I changed my major to communications last semester! Have you thought about asking your tutor for some assistance? Mine’s been really helpful.\n\nROBERT:   I’ve tried. I went to see her during her office hours and she wasn’t there… then I sent her an email and I got a reply saying that she’s away at a conference until the end of next week. Now I’m not sure how I’m going to finish my essay!\n\nFIONA:      Oh dear! Well, I may be able to help you. I did economics last year before I changed my major, remember?\n\nROBERT:   Really? That’d be great if you could. How much do you know about the music industry, Fiona?\n\nFIONA:      That’s your topic?\n\nROBERT:    Yes. We didn’t have much choice… it was either that or the tourism sector for this assignment… and now I have to write two and a half thousand words by the end of next week!\n\nFIONA:       Two and a half thousand? That doesn’t sound too bad, Robert! I did my essay for the same economics paper on the fishing industry. Perhaps I can give you some general advice… steer you in the right direction…\n\nROBERT:    Oh, yes please! If you could that would be great. I’ve been working on this paper for three weeks and I still feel as though I haven’t made any progress… and now there’s only one week left until the deadline!\nFIONA:      Okay, let’s see… the first one I was thinking of is by Jackson. Tom Jackson. It’s called “Principles of Economics” and that was published in 2008 by Oxford University, if I remember correctly.\n\nROBERT:  Wow, Fiona! You certainly do have a good memory, much better than mine I have to say. Let me just write it down in my notebook here… what was the title again?\n\nFIONA:    “Principles of Economics” by Jackson.\n\nROBERT:  Right, got it! That’s great… anything else?\n\nFIONA:     Well, there’s “Economics Research” from Cambridge University. I’m sure you would’ve heard of it. It was published in 2013. It’s a key text for most economics papers, you know…\n\nROBERT:  Yes, it does ring a bell… I should’ve paid more attention during my lectures! What’s the author’s name? It’s Jane something isn’t it?\n\nFIONA: Yes, that’s right. It’s Jane Kumar.\n\nROBERT: How do you spell that?\n\nFIONA: Kumar. K-U-M-A-R. Would you like me to spell the title for you as well?\n\nROBERT: Ha-ha, no… that’s fine. I think I’ve got it. Was there anything else?\n\nFIONA: Well, I’m sure you know about Michaela Petty’s book... the one on statistics from the University of Sydney?\n\nROBERT: Hmmm… no, I don’t think so. Do you think it would be helpful?\n\nFIONA: Definitely. It will be useful as a general reference and it’ll be a good look for the tutor to have it in your bibliography.\n\nROBERT: I see. Petty, you said. You don’t know the title and year it was published, by any chance?\n\nFIONA: That’s easy. Her book is called “Statistics”. It was published in 2006, although I’m sure there have been later editions put out by other universities. You should be able to find all three of those on reserve at the library.\n\nROBERT: Fiona, you’re a lifesaver! Thank you so much for helping me out with this essay. I suppose I’d best be getting along to the library now before it closes… I’ve got a deadline to meet after all…"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the second lecture in our Maritime School series.  Last week we looked at the range of documentation that is necessary for overseas export shipments, the Letter of Credit, the Bill of Lading, Customs documents, Certificates of Origin and Insurance documents, and <u>this week I want to look closely at one particularly form of documentation, the Bill of Lading.</u>\n\nFor international shipments, the Bill of Lading is probably the crucial document, as it links the exporter that is, the shipper, with the shipping line, the banks and the other required documents, such as Customs, Insurance and other Certificates, to prove that the goods being exported are of their true nature.  One of the problems with international shipments is that you have two companies in two separate countries, and both parties require guarantees, for example, the shipper requires the guarantee that they will be paid, and, of course, the importer requires the guarantee that they will receive the goods that they have ordered and paid for.\n\nThe first question to be considered, then, is who issues the Bill of Lading, and the answer is <u>the Shipping line</u>.  This document, as mentioned, is then given to <u>the exporting company, who pays the Shipping company</u> for carrying the goods to the importer’s country<em>.</em>\n\nAfter the Bill of Lading is received by the Exporter, it is in turn given to the Exporter’s bank, who will pay the Exporter for the value of the cargo.  At this point, the Bank is now in control and in ownership of the cargo.  <u>The Exporting bank will now send the Bill of Lading to the Importer’s bank</u> in their country, who will then control the cargo, and when they receive payment from the Importer, they will give the Bill of Lading to the Importer, who will have ownership of the cargo, and the transaction is now almost complete.\n\nNow, let’s look more closely at the preparation of the Bill of Lading.  At the top of the Bill of Lading, on the left-hand side, you will see three boxes.  The top box is for the Shipper information, which gives their proper company name, and their address, of course, so this is labeled ‘<u>Shipper</u>’.  The second box is to indicate who is importing the goods, the company that will own the cargo when it arrives, and they are called the ‘<u>Consignee</u>’, and that is spelled C-O-N-S-I-G-N-E-E.  Finally, the third box is to show who is to be advised when the cargo has arrived at the Importer’s country, and this is called the ‘<u>Notify Party</u>’, in other words, who is to be notified on arrival of the cargo.\n\nIn addition, as you can see from the copy of the Bill of Lading that has been handed out, there is a wide range of other information that is required to complete the Bill.  Some of the other key information that is necessary is the Shipping Company’s name, and here it is Southern Shipping, and the name of the vessel, which is Southern Cross.  Next is the <u>Port of Loading</u>, which, on our example here, is shown as Sydney, Australia.  The port of loading is where the cargo is loaded on the ship.  And, of course, there is the Port of Discharge, where the cargo is delivered to.\n\nSo, let’s review so far.  The Bill of Lading is a document used to facilitate the <u>movement</u> of cargo from one country to another, and it clearly outlines who controls the cargo while it is in shipment.  The Bill of Lading is created by the Shipping Company and is passed from one organization to another on payment of the value of the cargo, until it finally reaches the hands of the buyer in the importing <u>country</u>.  Of course, there are other considerations, such as Customs and Insurance to be considered, and these are the responsibilities of all the companies involved in the movement of the cargo and…"
