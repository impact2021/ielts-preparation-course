                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\n<strong>Woman:</strong>  Good afternoon, and welcome to the Travel Plus Travel Expo here in Victoria Bay.  My name is Jan Warfield, and I’m just going to give you a little bit of information about some of the exhibits here and the layout of the exhibition hall. Hopefully this will make it a little easier for you to find your way around and make your visit to the Travel Expo more enjoyable.\n\nFirstly, I hope you have all received your own <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q11: travel packs]</strong>, which contain brochures and leaflets from some of the exhibitors. The travel packs also include some discount coupons, so make sure to take a look before shopping today.  Now, I’d like to hand out these information forms - remember to fill them out before the end of the day, because each form puts you in the raffle for a trip for two to any location in the <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q12: South Pacific]</strong>, including flights with Island Airways.\n\nNow, let me tell you about what we have here in the exhibition hall.  When you first came in, you will probably have seen that there are booths already set up to let you know about all the offers available. On one side, you can find all the airlines that operate from here in Victoria Bay as well as other major cities on the west coast, and they continue all the way down the <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q13: right-hand]</strong> side of the exhibition hall.  You will be able to speak to the many representatives of the travel agencies as well as the airlines, both domestic and international, who have taken the opportunity to showcase their products.\n\nNow, lined up down the middle of the hall we have a number of hospitality organisations, such as the major hotel chains and some restaurants and vineyards. They would love to have the opportunity to speak with you as well, if you are thinking of a holiday overseas, or even a getaway here in our own country.  We also have a display from our own rail line, which as I am sure you know has just opened a wonderful scenic rail journey over the Central Mountains through to the capitol city.  Be sure to stop there and have a look at the video they have outlining the wonderful experience of taking the scenic train through the mountains, as well as the food and drink on offer in the dining carriage at the front and the brand-new rail carriages with glass rooves which allow you to take in the all the scenery.\n\nNext to the South Pacific tourism section, we have representatives from three cruise companies who operate cruise ships out of Victoria Bay through the <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q15: summer months]</strong>, and one company is even looking at taking advantage of island cruises through the winter season as well, so I strongly recommend taking a look there.\n\n<em>.  </em>\n\n<em> </em>\n\nNow I’m very excited to let you know about something new we have for you at this year’s Travel Expo – the viewing rooms.  We have two viewing rooms and throughout the day, there will be a number of videos showcasing the different countries and locations you can visit.  The schedule for those videos is on a large display outside each of the viewing rooms, but I should tell you that Viewing Room A is slightly larger than Viewing Room B, although even in the smaller room you can still comfortably fit 50 people.\n\nI’ll just give you an idea of some of what they’ll be showing. Viewing Room A opens at 11 a.m., starting with a 20-minute presentation of travel through <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q16: South-East Asia]</strong>, and this will include some wonderful panoramas of Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as other South-East Asian destinations. Additionally, representatives from travel organisations will be there to answer any questions about these destinations and they have many years’ experience in these locations, with some of them living there now.  The schedule continues with an <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q17: 11:45]</strong> a.m. viewing, and that will feature Canada and the United States, and the many wonderful experiences they have to offer, from train rides across Canada, to Hollywood, New York and all the big-city excitement that is North America.  Oh, and don’t forget the Grand Canyon in the U.S., as well as cruises from Vancouver in Canada up to Alaska.\n\nFollowing that, there is a short video showcasing Japan, Korea and China, which will be showing at 1 p.m., Europe and Britain, with all their history, are on at 1:45, South America, including <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q18: Brazil]</strong> and Argentina, at 2:30, and many more.  We hope there will be something for everyone!\n\nFinally, the other viewing room, Viewing Room B, will be showing videos of different traveling options, such as cruises, bus tours, river and canal cruises through Europe, at <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q19: 12:30]</strong>, and for those relatively new to international travel, an overview of what <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q20: air travel]</strong> is like today, which will be on at 3 o’clock.  And this includes destinations, types of aircraft, et cetera.  I’m sure you’ll agree that there is something for everyone.\n\nAlright, enough from me, so enjoy your day.  Thank you very much, folks, and have a great time here at the Travel Expo."

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4 </strong>\n\nWe have been looking at differences in attitudes of members of different generations and we are now going to consider the economic discrepancies between different age groups; this means the different attitudes they may display with regards to <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q38: money management]</strong>.\n\nTraditionally, <u>in many cultures, older generations - let’s say the 45 and above age group - have attached a great deal of value to (Q31) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q31: saving]</strong> money and also establishing security through buying their own home. According to Economist Simon Felder priorities are changing regarding both of these aspects for younger age groups in that they have been less important issues.</u> We’ll look at saving and house buying individually. First of all, let’s consider home-ownership. Firstly, in countries such as the UK , <u>while younger people may still have the desire to buy their own home, many under 30 year olds are actually unable to do so due to (Q32) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q32: increasing house prices]</strong></u>. <u>In many major cities in the UK , public sector workers such as (Q33) teachers or <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q33: nurses]</strong> are excluded from the property market due to economic pressures. </u>\n\n<u>There has also been a relatively recent trend for individuals with a higher than average disposable income to purchase two or more properties; one for their own use and the additional houses as investments which they rent out to tenants; this has also added pressure for (Q34) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q34: first time buyers]</strong>,</u> as general property prices have increased as a result. Many younger people now need to remain in shared rental property or continue to live with their parents, as they find it impossible to buy their own home.\n\nPeople are also tending nowadays to settle into a romantic relationship later in life; <u>many people not opting to (Q35) marry until their mid-thirties</u>. Single people dependent on only one income often find it even more difficult to raise adequate finances to buy their own home. In response to the increased challenges in the housing market, some young professional people are now opting to invest in property with a friend, or even a like-minded acquaintance who also wishes to buy their first home, but is single and cannot afford the cost of a mortgage on their own.\n\n<hr />\n\nLet’s move on now to the other point we raised earlier – that of saving money. Many sociologists believe that attitudes regarding long term planning versus the desire to obtain immediate gratification: that is ‘the wish have everything now’ vary quite dramatically in older and younger generations. According to Anne Hartwell, a prominent social scientist, <u>the “Baby Boomer” generation (those born between (Q36) 1945 and <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q36: 1964]</strong>) tend to retain the traditional values of saving and moderation with regards to expenditure</u>; <u>whereas, younger generations of today have a tendency to spend money in the (Q37) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q37: present]</strong> thinking less about the consequences of the future. </u>\n\n<u>Many educators believe that education about (Q38) money management and long term planning is vital for the youth of today</u>. <u>It is unrealistic to expect young people to act responsibly regarding their spending if little is done to ensure they have the basic skills to manage their own (Q39) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q39: budget]</strong></u>.While many subjects are taught in school, very few education institutions offer an insight into skills that will assist pupils with coping with real life once they enter the world of work.\n\n<u>For many young people, saving money is extremely difficult, as the (Q40) <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">[Q40: cost of living]</strong> rises a high percentage of the population struggle to meet the costs of day to day life.</u> Anne Hartwell believes that banks, building societies and other such financial institutions offer additional support in helping their customers manage their finances so that fewer people fall into debt."
