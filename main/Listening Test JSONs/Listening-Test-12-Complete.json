                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">Hello, everyone… my name is Mary\nTaylor… I am the manager here at the Fairview Arms Hotel... now, while our\nfriendly porters are carrying your luggage upstairs to your rooms, I would like\nto take a few moments to tell you a little bit about our lovely hotel where\nyou’ll soon be enjoying what we at the Fairview Arms are sure will be a\nfantastic summer holiday...</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">The hotel was originally built during the last decade of the seventeenth century as a travellers’ inn for traders going to work at the local market, and additional outbuildings and land for the extensive gardens were added nearly two hundred years later, in eighteen eighty-eight, when a local lord, Lord Fairview, bought the inn and converted it into a hotel for holiday makers.</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">And so it remains today… the Fairview Arms Hotel has been operating as a seaside holiday destination in more or less its current form for well over a century. Of course, many of the facilities have been upgraded to meet the expectations of all of our guests, while the original buildings remain, their interiors having been patiently and faithfully restored… such as you see now here in the reception hall and foyer. </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">Now, while on the topic of facilities available here for your enjoyment and comfort during your stay with us… I would like to point out that the Olympic-size swimming pool has been cleaned recently, and, while it was off bounds last week, is now available for all to enjoy. Likewise, the tennis courts were resurfaced in our off season, and are free for all to use, although I should mention that the hotel squash courts are presently being upgraded, and we expect to reopen these by the end of next week, everything going according to schedule. </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">For the gourmands among you, I am very pleased to announce that the grand dining hall has just this morning been reopened to guests following a period of refurbishment… diners will be able to enjoy viewing the original nineteenth century paintings which have been\nrecently restored.</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">At the same time, the hotel souvenir shop is currently undergoing an extensive upgrade, and we would therefore\ndirect all of our valued guests to the nearby souvenir shop in the local village, just a ten-minute stroll from the hotel, if you would like to purchase any gifts or mementoes during your stay…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">Now, just before I let you go… thank you so much for your time and patience, everyone… a few of the hotel rules, as\nwell as important information for you, our guests, to help make your stay all that more pleasant and enjoyable…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">First and foremost, as this is a seaside resort, and out of consideration for the comfort of others, ourprofessional cleaning staff included, we would ask that you wear some type of footwear, be it shoes or sandals, at all times when inside the Fairview Arms and not in your suites… we have also found that this helps to minimise the amount of sand being brought indoors…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">The reception area and the main desk that you see here behind me used to be staffed from five-thirty a.m. until eleven-thirty p.m. on a day to day basis, although now I am pleased to tell you that the reception is open twenty-four hours a day…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">However, for those keen on dancing, I regret to say that the hotel ballroom is undergoing some renovations at\npresent… we are in the process of replacing the wooden floor, and so any keen dancers couldn’t put a foot wrong by visiting the nightclub across the road from the post office in the village for the time being…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">As regards our own facilities, we hope you enjoy the pool but be aware that diving is strictly prohibited. You may\nalso appreciate that, as a family holiday destination, we ask that any adult wishing to consume alcohol, such as a glass of wine with the evening meal, do so only in the bar or the dining hall of the hotel…</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">And, lastly, just before I let you head up to your rooms to relax or take a look around the hotel, I must remind\nyou that all guests are asked to keep noise to a minimum after eleven p.m. at night… this is to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to enjoy their stay here as fully as possible… anything else… oh, yes… there is a lunch being\nserved in the dining hall at midday, which is in fifteen minutes time… thank you again for your time, and  choosing to stay with us... I hope to get the chance to meet with all of you at some stage during your stay…</span>"

The time that we spent in Singbora, which is a small lakeside community some twelve hundred metres above sea level, has provided us with greater insight regarding some of the most pressing development issues in areas like this one…\n\n<strong>J</strong>: I couldn’t have put it better myself, Thomas… during much of the one and a half weeks since our return we have been preparing our presentation seminar… And now, I think the slide show is ready…we’d like to begin with an overview of the area that we visited…\n\n<em> </em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>T</strong>: As you can see from the first slide behind us, Singbora is located in an area of high elevation… Africa’s tallest peak, Kilimanjaro, is in fact located in north-eastern Tanzania… the number of people living in the wider we stayed  as tur project…opiccommunity where we stayed was twenty thousand at last count, and it is situated on the shores of Lake Victoria, which is the largest lake in Africa, as well as being the largest tropical lake in the world…\n\n<strong>J</strong>: The community we were working and living in, Singbora, is around one hundred and twenty kilometres from the regional capital and seven hundred kilometres, give or take, from the Tanzanian capital of Dodoma, which is located in the centre of the country…\n\n<strong>T</strong>: Yes… it may come as no surprise to many of you that the main sources of income and employment in Singbora do not derive from the car industry or IT sector, but from the fishing of freshwater species, and, to a lesser extent, formal and informal trade with nearby communities and larger settlements that are within easy travelling distance…\n\n<strong>J</strong>: And easy travelling distance does not necessarily mean by car for many of the local people, either, as I am sure all of you will appreciate…\n\n<strong>T</strong>: Now, as I am preparing to show you a short video clip detailing some of the specifics on the community and the development work that we were involved in, we would…\n\n<strong>J</strong>: Yes, before we go into much greater detail about the project work, Thomas and I would like to tell you our personal views and what we took away from the experience…\n\n<strong>T</strong>: I for one felt that even though there were many moments that were challenging and, to be frank, at times overwhelming in terms of the scale of some of the issues that are facing the local community… on the whole, it was a most rewarding experience, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we don’t regret our decision to participate in the project and offer what little help we were able to.\n\n<strong>J</strong>: I do agree with you there, Thomas, although… I must say that, for my part, and in spite of the minor difficulties and personal inconveniences that we experienced… the entire project really did prove to be very insightful, and helped to open my eyes to the realities of the situation as it exists today in many rural communities, such as Singbora,  including the tremendous amount of work that still needs to be done… I think that being there on the ground really brought that home in a way that text-based research often fails to do…\n\n<strong>T</strong>: Yes, Jessica… I couldn’t agree more… The clip is ready to go now, if you’d kindly view the screen while we dim the lights a moment…"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to this week’s lecture on man’s working relationship with the great waterways of the world.  Last week we discussed some of the more famous bridges of the world, and this week I’d like to look more closely at canals and how people have worked with the canal system as a form of transportation for people and tradable commodities, as well as its use in irrigation.\n\nAs mentioned, it is believed that canals, or man-made waterways used either to collect water, or link existing waterways, such as rivers and lakes, were first used as a form of irrigation, and there still exist canals directing water from the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers in ancient Mesopotamia, the area that is modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, and parts of Syria and Turkey, which date back to the 6<sup>th</sup> Century BC.  Also in the 6<sup>th</sup> Century BC, the great Persian ruler Darius I built a canal to transport goods that connected the Nile River and the Red Sea, which was two and a half thousand years before another great canal, the Suez, was constructed linking the Mediterranean and India and the Far East.  We’ll be looking at the Suez Canal in more detail later....\n\nMeanwhile, in China, some of the great early canals were being constructed from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Century BC – that’s over 2,300 years ago - which were used for both the transport of people and goods, and irrigation. Then in the 7<sup>th</sup> Century AD, one of the greatest engineering feats of the time was accomplished, some even calling it ‘brillliant madness’.  China’s main rivers run from the west to the east, and Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty had an idea to connect the rivers with a Grand Canal running from the south to the north, principally to move rice from the rich farmlands of the southern regions to the northern regions, and to move his armies at his will in order to better protect his empire.  China’s Grand Canal has become one of the great symbols of Chinese engineering, and at 1,764 kilometres in length is the longest man-made waterway in the world, and is now listed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.\n\nOne of the main problems in constructing canals, in particular for canals connecting different waterways over long distances, is that usually there are great differences in the water levels of different seas and oceans, and also through the length of the canal.  Originally, a very simple method was employed, known as a flash lock, that’s two words, ‘flash lock’, which would hold the water on one side and when opened, would carry a vessel through to the other side.  However, this meant that it was difficult to travel in the opposite direction, as water rushed through from one elevation to the other.  Chinese engineers working on the Grand Canal system in the 10<sup>th</sup> Century AD devised a more sophisticated lock, known as a pound lock, which has now become the standard operating lock in all modern canals, which allows water levels to be more controlled, allowing transport to be easily accomplished in both directions.  It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci refined the pound lock system, as designs were discovered in his writings, which appear to be later incorporated into the Milan canals in around 1500.\n\nAs well as famous cities that have intricate canals and locking systems, such as Venice, Amsterdam and Bangkok’s famous ‘klongs’, canals are also used to link major bodies of water, such as oceans and seas.  Two of the most famous are, of course, the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal.  As trading between nations began to really make its mark in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and with the advent of powered vessels, cutting sailing times became a prime concern, and, additionally, there was the element of safety, as vessels moved from Europe to the Far East, or from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.  Previously, they had to travel around the southern tip of Africa or South America, which were notorious for loss of both life and vessel.\n\nIn the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, construction began on the Suez Canal, linking the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, and this was completed in 1869, although many attempts had been embarked upon in previous years.  When opened, the Suez Canal had a huge impact on world commerce, as the sailing distance linking Europe and the markets and suppliers of the Indian sub-Continent and the East was reduced by 7,000 kilometres.  Today, the Suez Canal is 163 kilometres in length and carries around 17,000 vessels a year.  Interestingly, because the Mediterranean and Red Seas have approximately the same water level, there are no locks for vessels to navigate.\n\nThe Panama Canal was an altogether different situation, with various attempts ending in massive loss of life and at huge cost.  In the 1880s, the French began construction of the Panama Canal to link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but within only a couple of years, more than 20,000 workers died of tropical diseases, and it was left to the Dutch to attempt to complete the project.  However, in 1890, the Dutch called a halt to the project, again owing to disease and massive costs, and the site was handed to the Americans in 1902.  Thanks to better medical practices, the Canal was finally completed in 1914, with the loss of just 5,000 workers.   The locks of the Canal are just under 35 metres wide, and the depth is, in places, just 26 metres, while the travelling distance is measured at 77 kilometres.\n\nAs a final point, it is interesting to note that history shows us that canals have been in use for thousands of years on Earth, but certain scientists have claimed that Mars also appears to have an intricate system of canals cut. However, this is probably something best left to science fiction."
