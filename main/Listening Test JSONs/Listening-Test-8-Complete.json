My friend gave me your number because he says you have an house for rent and I was wondering if it was still available? I’m new to the city – I’ve only been here for 5 days, but I really need to find somewhere more permanent to live.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Yes, it is available, but we already have some people who are booked to come and see it tomorrow afternoon. We would like to find someone to rent the house by <strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, so we don’t have much time. Would you be free tomorrow to come and look at it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Oh, no, sorry, not tomorrow... I start my new job tomorrow, you see. How about if I come over <strong><em>this afternoon</em></strong> though, if you’re free?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Yes, that’s fine. We live nearby anyway, so that’s no problem. Now before you come, I think I should just let you know a few details about the house. First of all, there’s not much furniture in the place. There is a sofa and some chairs, and there is a kitchen table, but that’s about it. You’ll probably need <strong><em>a bed</em></strong> at least. I have a spare bedside table which you can use if you like, but it’s not in the house at the moment.  There is a telephone line though, and an internet connection.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Great, that sounds absolutely fine. My friend says he has some furniture I can have. Can I just check a few more things with you now, on the phone, before I come over and see you?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Sure, go ahead!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">So it’s a three bedroom house with a kitchen, dining room and living room, is that right?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Yes, that’s right. There are <strong><em>two bathrooms</em></strong> – one is connected to the main bedroom, and the other is downstairs.  Out the back there is a small garden which you can use, but you have to keep it neat and tidy. The grass will need to be cut at least once every few weeks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Oh, OK. Is there room for a table and chairs outside, do you think?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Oh yes, the garden is <strong><em>just over 4 metres long</em></strong>, so there’ll be plenty of room.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Great.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"2px solid #333\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\"> Where exactly is the apartment block? My friend said it was in Fernhill, but he didn’t know the street it was on. I have actually just got a job working in Fernhill, so I was looking for somewhere to live that was within walking distance.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">It’s on Cavendish Drive, number 103</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Is that near the supermarket on Smith Lane?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">No, not quite, but I can give you directions from the supermarket if that helps?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Oh, yes please. I’m having some problems with my phone so I can’t get the directions from the internet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">No problem. As you come out of the supermarket, you will see the <strong><em>post office just opposite.</em></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Oh yes, I know where that is.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Well, turn left just as you come out of the supermarket and go past Albert Park. At the end of the road, just after the park you’ll see James Street. Turn right and go up James Street past <strong><em>Hill Park</em></strong> on the left and you’ll see a…</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">I didn’t know there was another park!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Yes, it’s very nice. It’s just opposite the Mainland Bank. Anyway, go past the park and take the second road on the right.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">That’s opposite Davis Lane isn’t it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">No, that’s the <em>first</em> right– that’s <strong><em>Wood Lane</em></strong>. You need to take the second right, so go past Wood Lane until you see a row of houses on the left and a <strong><em>petrol station</em></strong> on the right. The petrol station is actually on the corner of James Street and Cavendish Drive.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Potential tenant</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">OK, I think I know where you mean.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"25%\">Apartment owner</td>\n<td width=\"75%\">Great.

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\n\nThanks for joining us... It is a pleasure to be here with you in Canada. Actually my first visit to your amazing country. Now for our cooking demonstration today, I’m going to show you how to make a main chicken dish which is a healthy meal but allows you to keep preparation time and washing up to a minimum!  With a few slight alterations the dish could serve quite well at an adult dinner party or as part of as a family dinner.\n\nFirst of all, you’ll need to pre-heat your oven as evenly as possible to 180 degrees Celsius. Now you’ll need one chicken breast per dinner guest – these should be skinless, boneless and trimmed nicely. Place the chicken pieces in a medium depth oven dish with the thicker sides together.\n\nRemember that using the fan on the oven is a useful way of distributing heat as evenly as possible, but a fan will cause your oven to be slightly hotter at the front than the back. For this reason put the thinner parts of the chicken towards the back of the dish and the oven so that your chicken pieces are more likely to cook evenly with the thicker parts at the front in the warmer part of the oven...\n\nOnce you’ve got your chicken laid out in your dish, sprinkle oregano generously over the chicken. You know, oregano is such a useful herb and interestingly enough its dried form is usually more full of flavour than when it is fresh. It’s a fantastic flavouring for many different types of meat dishes and is a staple herb used in Greek and Italian cookery. Oregano has an aromatic, warm but slightly bitter taste – it goes really well with lemony flavours which we will soon also add to this particular dish.\n\nThe next thing that you need to do is add the lemon. Now you can just squeeze the lemon juice out over the top of the chicken, but even better is to grate the outside of the lemon and to add what we call the zest from the rind – this gives a much zestier, rounded flavour which is a fantastic accompaniment to the oregano.\n\nNext, slice up some cheese – and add it to your baking dish. The best type of cheese for this kind of dish is feta cheese – most people have tried feta at some point, but if you are not familiar it is a semi-soft cheese traditionally made in Greece, Turkey and other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, very easy to get these days and its available in several varieties in most supermarkets in Canada. Cut the cheese into generous chunks – maybe two or three per person is a good guideline and place them in the dish with your meat.\n\nThen, drizzle some olive oil on top of the chicken pieces and the cheese to aid their browning - and the final thing you need to add before you put them in the oven is a sprinkling of black pepper. Since feta is a salty cheese you should not add any extra salt before cooking, but you may wish to put a salt cellar on the table for guests who have a preference for saltier foods.\n\nThe dish will take around 25 minutes to cook. Remember to make sure that the meat is cooking evenly and turn the dish part way through cooking if necessary.\n\nFor serving at a dinner party I would suggest that you serve with olives, salad and garlic bread. For a family meal you could serve with potatoes or rice and freshly steamed vegetables.\n\nChicken is an excellent source of protein and a rich source of most B vitamins. However, chicken skin is high in saturated fat and should be removed before eating as we have done for this recipe. We’ve used white chicken breast here – it could be replaced by thighs if you prefer but remember darker meat is higher in fat. If you find it hard to cook chicken correctly though, chicken thighs can be useful to use instead of the white meat as they are less likely to dry out if you overcook them.\n\nWell, I hope that you and your family and dinner guests enjoy this dish – in the next session we are going to look a preparation of a main meal involving salmon."

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\n\nThese days, when most people are looking for an answer to a question, the first place they go is the internet. In academic circles, this has also become increasingly true, with internet research becoming the prime location for finding information, with many published materials now only being available online. Although there are clearly benefits to this, in that the internet can deliver results quickly and, in many cases, from the comfort of your own home, there are also a number of pitfalls that you need to be aware of.\n\nTo begin, it is worth considering how information may end up on the internet in the first place. These days, even young children have the ability to create simple web pages which they can choose to fill with any information they deem fit. Add to that an understanding of how many search engines work, and you are left with the potential for completely erroneous information to be indexed and found by the researching surfer. The process of ‘peer review’ that traditionally kept poor information from being acknowledged is considerably more limited on the internet. A good example of this is the popular website ‘Wikipedia’. Claiming to be an ‘online encyclopaedia’ and built by the contributions of the internet-surfing public, this site has a reputation for incorrect content and unsubstantiated commentary, so much so that the founder of the site is now considering preventing users from editing the sources.\n\nIn order to use the internet as a credible research tool, there is a basic checklist that can help you decide whether the information has value or not. This is commonly known as the CARS checklist, with the acronym standing for credibility, accuracy, reasonableness and support. Let’s consider first of all the first step – credibility.  Is it clear which person, company or organization is responsible for the information on the site?  Is there a link to a page describing what the company or organization does and the people who are involved? This must be more than a simple email address – it needs to be a physical location. Also, can the expertise of the author be verified? Are the writer’s qualifications clearly stated somewhere on the site?\n\nSo if the course you are looking at passes the first critical analysis, you will then want to try to determine the accuracy of the information you are being presented with. Again, asking yourself a series of questions can help you decide. Are there many grammatical and spelling errors? A notable number of errors could indicate that the content is not credible. How long ago was the page updated? Often there is a ‘date modified’ stamp somewhere on the page (commonly at the bottom, in the footer of the page).\n\nIf you are satisfied with the credibility and accuracy of the material, you will then need to consider the reasonableness of the page you are viewing. Is the information presented neutrally, or is the writing attempting to ‘sell’ something – a point of view or a personal bias, for example? Check that the writing appears fair and balanced, and that it does not slant unfairly towards a particular direction. Angry or overly critical tones suggest that the information is not a suitable reference for academic work. Ideally what you are looking for is a calm, reasoned tone, arguing or presenting material thoughtfully and without being overly emotional. It’s also good practice to check that the website address, the section that begins with ‘www’, is appropriate to the content. For example, if you were researching the environmental impact of vehicle pollution, you would not expect a balanced point of view from a car manufacturer’s website. A final point with regards motivation is looking at the advertising that may be on the site. Some advertising, clearly separated from the content of the page, is acceptable, but if content and advertisement almost seem to merge with one another, it might be time to reconsider the source.\n\nFinally comes support. Are all factual claims clearly substantiated; that is, are there cited sources? Is there a bibliography or similar documentation? Can it be corroborated on other sites? It is worth keeping in mind that most information, if it is factually accurate, can be found in other sources. It is generally accepted that finding the same information in 3 separate sites, assuming they have all passed the previous three tests, is sufficient support to be credible.\n\nFollowing these basic steps can certainly help you steer clear of some of the worst websites, but while it may still be difficult to universally determine what aspects to look for in a good (or bad) source, there are several sorts of websites that can be useful source materials for the researcher.  Many museums, for example, have websites, either describing their collections in general, or showing a detailed gallery of their collections. Another excellent feature of such sites is that information can be verified or additional information can be sought by contacting the museum via the email addresses commonly present on such websites.\n\nAnother good source for reliable information can be online art galleries. Although the pictures in online art galleries are often simply scanned from art books, many of these websites can be helpful for viewing pictures (often in larger sizes or better detail than available in some print resources) as well as getting general information about the artists, such as their biography or background to the environment in which they lived.\n\nAnd perhaps the final piece of advice that I can offer about research in the internet is simply to use common sense. Some pieces of work may pass the CARS test but still leave you with some sense of disquiet. If that’s the case, it’s much better to leave it and move on."
