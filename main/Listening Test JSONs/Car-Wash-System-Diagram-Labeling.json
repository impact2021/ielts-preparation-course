    "transcript": "<p>Hello and welcome to the 'Sustaining our World' programme. Today, our topic is focussed on how car owners can minimise the impact on the environment with regards to how they choose to keep their vehicle clean.</p>\n\n<p>An impressive initiative from Denmark is worthy of consideration in other parts of the world. Developers of new treatment equipment there claim they are able to cut discharge of waste water from car washing activity by 90%, in addition to reducing chemicals discharged in waste water.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that an average conventional car wash would use around 163 litres of fresh water for each car washed, with an additional 110 litres of recycled water. The Carsmart System, although it uses about the same total amount of water, is fitted with special water treatment equipment, and would use only <span id=\"q11\" data-question=\"11\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q11) 35 litres</span> of fresh tap water for each vehicle washed. This saving is due to the fact that recycled and not fresh water is used for the washing of both the bottom and the top of the car <span id=\"q12\" data-question=\"12\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q12) 150 litres</span> and <span id=\"q13\" data-question=\"13\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q13) 90 litres</span> respectively). With the eco-friendly system, freshwater is only used for the final rinsing.</p>\n\n<p>Once the wash is completed, waste water is collected and drains into a <span id=\"q14\" data-question=\"14\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q14) sand trap</span>. With conventional systems, it is then filtered to first a suction chamber then an oil separator, before being expelled to a sewer. However, with the Carsmart system water is simply expelled to the sand trap then transferred immediately to the <span id=\"q15\" data-question=\"15\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q15) treatment tank</span>, where heavy metals, oils and other potentially hazardous compounds and chemicals from detergents are broken down. The process is nearly 5 times more effective than the traditional recycling procedure – only 35 litres of water, as opposed to <span id=\"q16\" data-question=\"16\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">(Q16) over 160 litres</span> with traditional systems, is disposed of into the sewage system; the rest being recycled for use in the next wash.</p>",
