How can I help you?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER: Well, I'm looking for a reasonably priced holiday. I went to South Africa for a month last year and I'd like to see North America this time – maybe Canada, but I'm also interested in Europe if the prices to Canada are too expensive. I'm on quite a tight budget you see.\r\n\r\n<p>TRAVEL AGENT: Well I can certainly get some prices for Canada for you. <span id=\"transcript-q1\" data-question=\"1\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q1</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Vancouver is lovely this time of year,</span> and we have some special offers on at the moment. There are also some special deals for Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CUSTOMER: Okay, well, <span id=\"transcript-q2\" data-question=\"2\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q2</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">I have some relatives over in Vancouver</span> so that would be good. I can always travel around Europe next year.</p>\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Right, let's have a look at some prices then. When would you like to go?\r\n\r\n<p>CUSTOMER:Some time at the end of the end of next month if possible, but I'm quite flexible anytime between the 24th to the 31st. <span id=\"transcript-q6\" data-question=\"6\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q6</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">I'd like to go for three weeks.</span></p>\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Well there's lots of availability for those dates. Now, if you're concerned about the cost, it's cheaper if you don't mind not flying direct.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Sorry? What do you mean?\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Well, if you don't mind changing planes then it's cheaper.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Oh, well, I don't mind changing planes.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: In that case, the cheapest flight I have leaves on the 25th and changes in New York. It's only a short stop – you'll be in the airport for two and a half hours. How does that sound?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Sounds good, but what's the price?\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: That's £412 for a return flight, but that doesn't include airport tax. Would you like to arrange any accommodation?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:No, I have a cousin I can stay with. All I need is the flight, so I think I'll take that one.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Right, I'll just check availability for your return. Three weeks did you say?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Yes, that's right.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Okay...well there are seats available on the 14th or the 15th. Which one would you prefer?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:The fifteenth sounds good. Yes, from the 25th to the 15th sounds fine.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: I'll reserve that for you then. Can you tell me your name please?\r\n\r\n<p>CUSTOMER:Sandra <span id=\"transcript-q3\" data-question=\"3\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q3</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Jackson.</span></p>\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Is that J-A-C-K-S-O-N?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:That's right.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: And can I take an address and contact number?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Yes, it's 10, Allen Road, Oldham. Do you want a home number or my mobile?\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Either's fine.\r\n\r\n<p>CUSTOMER:Well, my home number is 0151 <span id=\"transcript-q4\" data-question=\"4\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q4</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">433 398</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRAVEL AGENT: Great. Now, one more thing. Do you have any <span id=\"transcript-q7\" data-question=\"7\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q7</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">travel insurance?</span> We recommend all our clients take some kind of cover, even though most people don't end up needing it. Most people have it just for peace of mind.</p>\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Well, what times of cover do you have?\r\n\r\n<p>TRAVEL AGENT: Our most comprehensive cover is the <span id=\"transcript-q8\" data-question=\"8\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q8</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Gold Star,</span> which will cost £21 for the period you are away. It's a good policy because it covers almost all eventualities, even extreme sports such as snow boarding and skydiving.</p>\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Well, I don't plan to do anything that dangerous, but £21 sounds fine so I'll take that too please.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:Well, do you have any information about what to do in Vancouver?\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Yes, I'm sure there's something on the computer that can help. Ahh, yes.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER:There's a Shakespeare play at the theatre, but it's quite expensive. That starts at 8pm. The city museum is really popular too, if you like that kind of thing. They have a special exhibition of Japanese armour next month. Entrance is free and the museum is open from 9.00 to 4.30 Monday to Saturday. Would you be interested in either of those?\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Oh, well..errr, maybe. (sounds hesitant)\r\n\r\n<p>CUSTOMER:Well, I'm sure you can arrange that when you get there anyway. So, it's the flight and the Gold Star insurance. That's… <span id=\"transcript-q10\" data-question=\"10\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q10</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">£433 in total.</span></p>\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AGENT: Can I pay by visa?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMER: Yes of course.

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 2</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much for inviting me here today. l understand that you all own your own home, and <span id=\"transcript-q11\" data-question=\"11\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q11</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">some of you may be interested in buying additional property here in the city,</span> so I hope you will find the information l am going to share with you useful and informative. I am going to talk about the situation with property here in the city. The city centre of any area is obviously going to have the highest prices and as more and more people are competing for houses in this area, <span id=\"transcript-q12\" data-question=\"12\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q12</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">both renting and buying are becoming increasingly difficult.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is most people's dream to, one day, own their own house. House ownership gives us a feeling of having achieved something and we can see clearly what we have worked so hard for all our lives. It can give us a sense of security for our old age and a knowledge that we will hopefully have something to pass on to our children. However, buying a house, particularly for first-time buyers, <span id=\"transcript-q13\" data-question=\"13\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q13</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">is becoming more and more difficult,</span> not only due to increasing prices but also because of the need for a substantial deposit. For younger people, buying their first home is very difficult and often impossible. Young couples who cannot get the deposit together, need to rent for a long time and sometimes forever. While, traditionally, homes near the centre of the city have been the most desirable, people are now looking further afield. This has happened for a number of reasons, the main one being that our style of work is changing along with that of other countries such as the USA. In certain professions, for example sales and computing, it is no longer necessary for people to be based in an office full-time. <span id=\"transcript-q14\" data-question=\"14\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q14</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">More and more people are beginning to work from home</span> which means they can avoid the hustle and bustle of rush-hour traffic jams into work and have more freedom to choose to live in a more rural and peaceful location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My company deals with finding property for both purchasers and renters in the city area. One of my main roles within the company is to find <span id=\"transcript-q15\" data-question=\"15\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q15</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">investment properties</span> for people who wish to plan ahead for their future.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p>An investment property is usually at the <span id=\"transcript-q16\" data-question=\"16\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q16</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">cheaper end of the market.</span> People buy investment properties, not to live in, but in addition to their own home in order to rent it out to other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantage of putting your savings into property for the future is that you can be pretty certain that, as a long-term investment, your money will safely increase in value in line with inflation. Many people are turning to property investment instead of <span id=\"transcript-q17\" data-question=\"17\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q17</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">pension schemes</span> as we hear the horror stories of countries such as the UK, where people have invested all their lives into their pension schemes to find that now their money is relatively worthless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Houses automatically earn what is known as capital gains; that is, for every year you own the property, it becomes more valuable and often gives a better rate of interest on your money than most banks do. However, that is not to say there are no risks. There are people who buy property when the market is high and prices are inflated beyond their true value, only to find that when the housing market slows down, they are in a state of <span id=\"transcript-q18\" data-question=\"18\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q18</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">negative equity.</span> Negative equity is a situation that arises when you owe more for the house than the house itself is worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short: the best advice is to be aware of the ups and downs of the housing market. Property investment, if handled correctly, can be <span id=\"transcript-q19\" data-question=\"19\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q19</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">enormously satisfying.</span> I hope that this has given you an insight into the basics of the property market. Thank you for listening. Please <span id=\"transcript-q20\" data-question=\"20\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q20</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">raise your hand</span> if you have any questions and I will try to be of assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Can you tell me the current lion population in Africa these days?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Professor Ripley</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well  it is very difficult to measure it accurately. Figures range from 100 000, to as few as 30 000, but it is generally estimated that there are <span id=\"transcript-q25\" data-question=\"25\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q25</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">50 000.</span> In order to maintain the population and protect the species from poachers, many are moved to protected areas.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Interviewer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Which member of the cat family do you feel is most at risk?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Professor Ripley</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">For different reasons, a number of species of the cat family are endangered. Sometimes due to natural predators or environmental changes, but mainly because of the threat of <span id=\"transcript-q26\" data-question=\"26\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q26</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">hunters.</span> For example, I am sure you are aware, the bones and body parts of tigers have been, and still are, traditionally used in medicines in the Far East. Because of this and the demand for medicine made from tiger parts, their numbers have been falling for some time and to date -there are fewer than <span id=\"transcript-q27\" data-question=\"27\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q27</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">6000 tigers</span> living in their natural habitat of the forests and plains of Asia.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Interviewer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">What is being done to curb the population decrease?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Professor Ripley</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well, specialists such as myself work closely with conservationist groups such as the World Wildlife Federation, or WWF, to protect tigers from illegal hunting. WWF considers the drop in tiger numbers to be catastrophic and they are working hard to conserve the populations in China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Russia.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Interviewer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">I understand that poaching is not the only problem faced by the leopard... let me get this right  is it the snow leopard which lives in the mountains in Asia?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Professor Ripley</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Yes, it is. Poaching has been a problem, but not the most important. its natural prey—the animals it hunts — is declining too. its natural habitat in high—altitude areas, specifically the pastures, is threatened by the growth of <span id=\"transcript-q28\" data-question=\"28\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q28</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">agriculture.</span> lt is this that is causing the main problem for the snow leopard. It is going to be extremely difficult for numbers to recover, but again the WWF has been working hard to continue to fund projects to aid the snow leopard in <span id=\"transcript-q29\" data-question=\"29\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q29</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Nepal and Pakistan,</span> and hopefully Bhutan very soon.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Interviewer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Well this is fascinating information you are giving us, Professor, we are just going into a short commercial break. When we come back l have a few questions for you about the puma and the jaguar. Remember listeners, there will be an opportunity to phone in and voice any opinions or questions you may have for the professor <span id=\"transcript-q30\" data-question=\"30\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q30</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">in ten minutes.</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"

                "transcript": "<strong>Section 4</strong>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Announcer</strong>: Good afternoon. l'm pleased to see so many of you here today. As I told you all on Monday, the lecture on overpopulation has been postponed until next week as we have <span id=\"transcript-q31\" data-question=\"31\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q31</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">a guest speaker today.</span> l'd like to introduce you all to Donald Mackenzie, who has recently returned from a 12-month research project in America. He is here to share with us some of the results of his studies into the problem of illiteracy. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Donald Mackenzie</strong>: Hello. Now, as sociology students, I have no doubt that you are aware that it is commonly believed that one indicator of a developed country is the level of education of its citizens. Most of these nations have free compulsory education for all and strict teacher certification requirements, so it would logically follow that people from countries such as America would be highly educated. Yet this isn't always so: in America alone, 42 million adults <span id=\"transcript-q32\" data-question=\"32\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q32</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">cannot read</span> and 50 million can recognise so few printed words they each have the reading ability of a <span id=\"transcript-q33\" data-question=\"33\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q33</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">10-year-old.</span> Frightening statistics indeed, but not as frightening as the trend suggested by current estimates — the number of illiterate adults is increasing by approximately <span id=\"transcript-q34\" data-question=\"34\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q34</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">two and a quarter million</span> people each year, and although global statistics have not been compiled, it suggests an extremely disturbing figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inevitably, this is having an impact on employment. In America, the annual cost in welfare programmes and unemployment compensation due to illiteracy stands at <span id=\"transcript-q35\" data-question=\"35\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q35</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">six billion US dollars,</span> and an additional $237 billion a year in unrealised earnings is forfeited by people who lack basic reading skills. There is also the cost of post-school literacy programmes, which have been put in place in order to counter this increasing figure. A conservative estimate places the cost of these programmes at <span id=\"transcript-q36\" data-question=\"36\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q36</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">10 billion dollars</span> each year, and growing steadily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, l'd like to talk about some of the causes of this increasing illiteracy. Children were taught to read by, first learning the alphabet, then the sounds of each letter, how they blended into syllables, and how those syllables made up words. They were taught that English spelling is logical and systematic, and that to become a ﬂuent reader it was necessary to master the alphabetic code in which English words are written, to the point where the code is used automatically with little conscious thought given to it. To make myself clear, I mean readers could sound out the letters, spelling them phonetically. Once a child learned this ability, attention could be turned to more advanced content. It seldom, if ever, occurred to teachers to give children word lists to read, or to make beginner-level readers memorise whole words before learning the components of those words, or to memorise whole stories as today's proponents of the whole-language approach recommend. <span id=\"transcript-q37\" data-question=\"37\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q37</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Several recent studies have found that 90 per cent of remedial reading students in developed countries are not able to decode fluently,</span> accurately, and at an automatic level of response. The currently used 'whole language' method was originally conceived and used in the early 1800s to teach the deaf how to read, a method which has long since been discarded by the teachers of the deaf themselves as inadequate and outmoded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English is an alphabetic language that, when written, uses letters to represent speech <span id=\"transcript-q38\" data-question=\"38\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q38</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">sounds.</span> When students were taught to read, they consciously identified the speech sounds and learned to recognise the letters used to represent them. They were then trained to apply this information to decode the names of written words, understand their meaning, and comprehend the information presented as a complete thought. The English language contains approximately half a million words. Of these words, about 300 compose about three-quarters of the words we use regularly. As I said, in schools where the 'whole language' method is taught, children are constantly memorising sight words during the first three or four grades of school, but are never taught how to unlock the meaning of the other 499 700 or more words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whole-language learning causes frustration, poor <span id=\"transcript-q39\" data-question=\"39\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q39</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">spelling</span> and hostility towards reading. Very bright children who can't memorise long lists of words and retain their meaning are placed in special education, when all they need is to be taught the 26 letters of the alphabet, the 44 sounds they make, and the 70 common ways to spell those sounds. Some researchers believe dyslexia and the symptoms of Attention Deficit Disorder are actually caused by this reversal of the normal learning sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why do faulty reading methods continue to be used? Well, in short it's <span id=\"transcript-q40\" data-question=\"40\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q40</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Big Business!</span> The sale of instructional reading programmes is big business today: each year publishing companies compete for the adoption of reading programmes and workbooks which have to be replaced annually. Concentrating on phonics would seriously reduce the cost of education.</p>"
