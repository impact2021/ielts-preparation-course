            "question": "<p>The diagram shows the common design of a house in North America, the home is quite large and there are 8 labelled parts to the diagram.</p>\r\n<p>The house can be divided into three clear parts; the garage area, the nested storey above the garage and to the right of these is the ground floor section. The nested storey, which is elevated above the garage, has a low gradient roof.</p>\r\n<p>The dwelling has a sizeable double garage which also includes an extra entrance way . Access to the house is at the rear of the building. A ventilation window can be seen above the double garage door.</p>\r\n<p>The building has four separate roofs, three of which are low gradient. The ground floor section roof is different in that it has a sharp slope . Five sets of windows can be seen in the illustration ; the largest are located at the front of the nested storey, on the side of the garage at the front of the ground floor section.</p>\r\n<p>This ends the depiction of the diagram.</p>\r\n<p>1.

                    "no_answer": "The correct answer is 'access'. Tip: 'Entry' and 'access' both relate to how you get into a building. Look for sentences that describe where or how you can enter. Check paragraph 3."

                    "no_answer": "The correct answer is 'elevated'. Tip: This word describes position or height. When something is 'elevated', it's positioned higher than something else. Look for descriptions of what's above the garage in paragraph 2."

                    "incorrect": "The correct answer is 'illustration'. Look in paragraph 4: 'Five sets of windows can be seen in the illustration'. Both 'diagram' and 'illustration' refer to the visual representation being described. Writers vary their vocabulary to avoid repetition.",
                    "no_answer": "The correct answer is 'illustration'. Tip: Notice how the writer avoids repeating 'diagram' throughout the text. In paragraph 4, 'illustration' is used to refer to the same visual. These synonyms help make writing more sophisticated."

                    "incorrect": "The correct answer is 'depiction'. Look at the final paragraph: 'This ends the depiction of the diagram'. A 'depiction' is a formal way of saying 'description' or 'representation'. Both mean showing or describing something in detail.",
                    "no_answer": "The correct answer is 'depiction'. Tip: This is in the concluding sentence. 'Depiction' is a sophisticated, formal word meaning 'description' or 'portrayal'. Good IELTS writing uses varied vocabulary like this."
