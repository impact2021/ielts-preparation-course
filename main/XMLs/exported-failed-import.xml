<td valign="top" width="70%">Hello, Greenlee kennels here, how can I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Hi there, I'm ringing to enquire about you advertisement I saw on the internet. Do you still have any puppies for sale?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, I do. I've got two boys and one girl left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">What colours do you have left? You had some black and some gold coloured dogs advertised on the website I saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, I've only got black puppies left now; the last of the golden ones was sold yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Well, I'm interested in buying a male puppy. <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q1: his daughter]</strong> I want it to be a companion for my daughter. Do you think the puppies are good with children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, I raise them in the house and they're very good with other dogs and children. My grandson plays with them all the time. They're still very young remember, so they'll adapt really easily to living in a household with children around full-time. Just remember to tell your little girl to be very gentle, especially at first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">How old are they now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">They're seven weeks old. I let them go when they are 8 weeks or older, so they'll be available for their owners to take home in <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q2: one week]</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Okay, that sounds great. Now can I arrange to come and see you and the puppies. When would be convenient?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Well, any day this week is fine, apart from <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q3: Friday afternoon]</strong>, I'll be out at a dog show then. When would you like to come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">How about on Thursday - the day after tomorrow. Would it be okay if I come at around 10.30am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Can you make it 11am instead, that would suit me better if it's okay for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, 11am is fine. Is your place easy to find?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q4: a big sign]</strong> I've got a big sign outside, we're opposite the new leisure centre on Westlands Rd. I'm at number 157.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">157 Westlands Rd - isn't Westland Rd near Barnett Drive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, it is. <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q5/6: <strong>[Q5: D]</strong>-fruit and vegetable shop, <strong>[Q6: E]</strong>-craft shop]</strong> After the traffic lights, you come along Barnett Drive and you'll see a fruit and vegetable shop on the left hand side. Just after that you'll see a craft shop. Go past the craft shop and you'll see a cafe on your right. Take the second right after the cafe - that's Westlands Rd, it's the one after Banks Drive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Okay, that's fine, thanks. I think I know here you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">I have another question for you. I'm thinking of getting the puppy micro-chipped, so that if it gets lost it could be easily traced and returned to us. Do you think that's a good idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, I do. There are many advantages to micro-chipping when you compare it to other forms of identification. Collars and tags can be convenient but they're also easily taken off or <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q7: lost]</strong>. Micro-chipping is permanent. In very rare cases you might have a situation where the microchip moves in the dog's body so it can't be found and scanned, but you can always have the chip checked every now and then to make sure it's still working properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Does it hurt the dog? When they put the microchip in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">No. The microchip is really small, roughly the size of a grain of <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q8: rice]</strong>. Because it's so small it makes it easy for the vet to put in; it can be easily injected between the shoulder blades of even the smallest dog. The dog being injected rarely notices any discomfort for more than a few <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q9: seconds]</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Are there any risks involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">There's a very small risk of infection - but you can minimise this by just taking a bit of extra care of the area for a while - make sure it doesn't get <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q10: dirty]</strong> - that sort of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Well thanks for that advice, it gives us something to think about. I'll see you soon then - we're looking forward to meeting you and of course the puppies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="30%">Breeder</td>
<td valign="top" width="70%">Yes, looking forward to meeting you too. See you soon.</td>
