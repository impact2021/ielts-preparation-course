IMPORTANT: This XML file has structural corruption and CANNOT be imported.

The _ielts_cm_questions data is fundamentally corrupted (truncated/malformed serialization)
and cannot be automatically repaired. The file was broken from its original export.

TO FIX: Re-export this exercise from WordPress after:
1. Replacing all en-dashes (–) with regular hyphens (-)
2. Replacing all curly quotes (' ' " ") with straight quotes (' ")
3. Verifying all question data is complete
