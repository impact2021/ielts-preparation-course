<td valign="top" width="80%">Hi, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to find out more about the winter specials you are advertising at the moment.</td>

<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Okay, well we’re offering weekly deals and long weekend specials at the moment. Which are you interested in ?</td>

<td valign="top" width="80%">Well, I’m not too sure at the moment. Can you tell me a little about both?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Yes, of course. The long weekend specials run from Thursday to Sunday or from Friday to Monday. You need to book for a minimum of three nights. For the weekly packages you receive a 5% discount, free parking at any London airport if you choose to fly here and pick up from our local airport.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Oh right. I don’t think we’ll fly - we’re planning to stay somewhere on the way for a night or two to break up the journey as we’re planning on coming by car. What prices do the rooms work out to be for the three night package?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">It depends if you would like to book for the room only, room with breakfast, room with breakfast and dinner, or for the room with breakfast each day and dinner first night only – there are four options you see. And of course it also depends on how many people you would you be booking for.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Well, I was wondering about what kinds of things there are to do nearby. We’ve never been down there before. Actually we’re looking to buy a house in the local area, so thought we’d come and have a look around at some properties. We’ll still have some free time left and intend to do some sight-seeing too.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Well, Hardwell Castle is a must see. It’s a beautiful castle set in 60 acres of land and it was built in the 13th century. Part of the castle now serves a museum and you can see a fascinating selection of antique furniture, art, period dress and armaments and armour.</td>
