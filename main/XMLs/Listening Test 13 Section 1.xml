(Phone rings)

RECEPTIONIST: Good morning. How can I help you?

CUSTOMER: Hello. Is this Southern rental car?

RECEPTIONIST: Yes, it is.

CUSTOMER: I wonder if you could help me. I’m ringing from Nelson, but I’m coming over to Auckland for 12 days and and I’d like to hire a car.

RECEPTIONIST: OK. I'll fill in the booking for you now. First, can I take your name?

CUSTOMER: Yes, It’s William Waddell.

RECEPTIONIST: Sorry, could you spell your surname?

CUSTOMER: Yes it’s W-A-D-D-E-L-L

RECEPTIONIST: Thanks. And can I have an address and phone number?

&nbsp;

CUSTOMER: Sure, I live at 10 Robyn Place. That’s R-O-B-Y-N Place.

RECEPTIONIST: And that’s Nelson, isn’t it?

CUSTOMER: That’s right. Do you want my home number of my mobile?

RECEPTIONIST: Home number will be fine.

CUSTOMER: OK, it's 07 263 8666.

RECEPTIONIST: Great! Now, can I also have a credit card number?

CUSTOMER: Do I have to pay by credit card?

RECEPTIONIST: Well, we need a credit card number as a guarantee. It’s a standard policy for car rentals.

CUSTOMER: OK. Well, I'll pay by Visa then. The card number is... 4550 1392 8309 3221.

RECEPTIONIST: And the expiry date?

CUSTOMER: Sorry?

RECEPTIONIST: Your card – when does it expire?

CUSTOMER: Oh, next July.

RECEPTIONIST: Right. Now how long did you want the car for? 12 days did you say?

CUSTOMER: No, I only need the car for 10 days - from the 2nd to the 11th of next month.

<hr />

RECEPTIONIST: Now, what type of car are you looking to hire?

CUSTOMER: Well, I’m not too worried about the model of the car, but I understand that you have rental cars from just $25 a day. Is that correct?

RECEPTIONIST: We do sometimes have the $25 dollar deals, but only in the low season. For the period you are looking at, the cheapest we have is $35. However, that price includes unlimited kilometres.

CUSTOMER: Sorry, did you say unlimited kilometres? What does that mean exactly?

RECEPTIONIST: That means that no matter how far you go, the cost is the same. Some companies charge for rental and then charge again for every kilometre you actually drive.

CUSTOMER: Well, I am going to be travelling quite long distances – I’m visiting relatives and they live quite far apart from each other, so unlimited kilometres are probably a good idea.

RECEPTIONIST: If you're travelling long distances,  you would be better with an automatic. Changing gears in a manual can make it more expensive on petrol.

CUSTOMER: OK, I'll take the automatic then.

RECEPTIONIST: Rught, so that's an automatic car for 10 days from the 2nd to the 11th. That's all booked. Is there anything else I can help you with?

CUSTOMER: No, that's fine. Oh, sorry - what do I need to bring with me when I pick up the car?

RECEPTIONIST: All you need is your driving licence.

CUSTOMER: Right, well thanks very much. Bye!
