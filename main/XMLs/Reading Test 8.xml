<h4>Reading Passage 1: The pressure on Junior Doctors</h4>
<p>In comparison with the lives of other postgraduate students, the life of a student doctor is far from easy. Despite the heavy workload, it seems that the more you learn, the more you realise what you still need to study, meaning that it becomes increasingly complex and difficult as the course progresses. As a result, it is not unusual for students to drop out. Misguided teachers attempt to simplify matters, but this can then result in incomplete understanding in an environment that demands the very best of its practitioners, and this can cause the situation.</p>

<p>The situation is little better in the year or two years after qualifying. Poorly paid for such long hours, many junior doctors find themselves becoming disillusioned with medicine. The more depressed they become, the more likely they are to look elsewhere for a career, wasting up to seven years of training and education. An unfortunate statistic is that of those that qualify as doctors, 18% do not remain in the profession for more than three years.</p>

<p>The problem can be more clearly defined by considering specific examples. In New Zealand and Britain, for example, the exodus of medical graduates is leaving the remaining newly qualified doctors with responsibilities that are beyond their capacity. In statistics from 1998 over half the graduates from one medical school in New Zealand left the country immediately after qualifying, and hospitals are really beginning to feel the shortage. Certain hospitals in Auckland, for example, do not have enough staff to cover the timetable, and some of the newly qualified doctors are finding themselves on call for 48 hours straight. In Britain, the situation is equally bleak.</p>

<p>The structure of the health service itself is the most important factor to be taken into account when considering the number of migrating British medical graduates. Junior doctors are required to take mentors, more senior doctors (often consultants), to act as supervisors. They are entrusted with the educational supervision of doctors in their first year of practice and are responsible for ensuring the application of the principles of good medical practice. However, when interviewed, slightly less than 60% of junior doctors had any positive feedback on the relationship. The remaining respondents described situations in which a consultant was accused of making unreasonable demands, bullying, being unfair, or being sexist. In more extreme cases, the consultant was portrayed as incompetent, insensitive or negligent towards patients.</p>

<p>A healthy mentoring relationship is likely to provide the mental and moral challenges essential to continuing self-improvement. But such statistics may encourage junior doctors to conclude that role models may not be a dependable way to impart professional values, attitudes and behaviour. Indeed, a survey of just under 200 nearly qualified doctors highlights significant gaps in their knowledge and understanding of basic care. It was found that many junior doctors do not know the signs indicating a patient is critically ill, a third of respondents failed to answer a question on how to deal with someone who was unconscious and none of the trainees identified all of the steps involved in using an oxygen mask.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, the situation, although having essentially the same effect of fewer junior doctors, has different causes. There are two main factors which explain this mass migration of medical graduates from New Zealand. The first factor is the student loans system where a medical graduate can leave university having accumulated a loan of anything up to NZ$60 000 in the course of training. By leaving the country, such graduates have the option of at least delaying the repayment of those loans. The other reason is the long hours. The stories of working hours a week being almost in the three-figure mark are often not exaggerated, and this is a situation which is worsening the fewer junior doctors there are.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, at least, a solution is being sought at a student level. The New Zealand Medical Students Association (NZMSA) is a national body that aims to advance the long-term interests of medical students and act as their advocate on a political level. Composed of students elected from the Otago and Auckland Medical Schools, the NZMSA aims to find a balance between the demands of the profession and the expectations of junior doctors. At a recent conference, the Association concluded that increasing student numbers or attracting overseas doctors is too short term to be successful and the roots of the problem need to be addressed, specifically in the area of student debt. Either way, there is no doubt that a solution is needed and needed quickly, not just in Britain and New Zealand, but in most countries.</p>

<h4>Reading Passage 2: Migration – the incredible journey</h4>
<p>Twice a year, certain species of birds make immense journeys, often in excess of ten thousand miles, spending the summer months in a temperate climate and the rest of the year in more tropical climates. This migration is a long journey which many birds do not complete, yet it is an essential part of their natural pattern.</p>

<p>Many reasons can be given for this migration. Some argue that it is a result of some birds being unable to withstand extremes of temperature, especially the cold weather, explaining why many birds migrate to Africa during the European winter. It has also been suggested that this migration is a result of travelling instincts of millennia ago, before the continents drifted apart. As the land mass spread, birds continued to travel the required distance back to the area they knew was a good source of food or protection. The primary cause, however, is considered to be the search for food, particularly for their chicks. Staying in one place, the food sources would become increasingly scarce.</p>

<p>In preparation for their long journey, migratory birds undergo a number of physical and chemical changes. These changes are triggered by the rising or falling daylight and result in a considerable increase in the birds' appetite (up to 40% more than during other times of the year). This food is stored in fat deposits and in some long-distance migrants, this fat becomes 30-50% of their weight, ready to be released gradually to fuel their journey. In addition, they are also considerably more active at night, influenced by chemical changes preparing them for their long-distance haul. Most birds travel long distances overnight, partly as migratory flight generates considerable heat that needs night-time temperatures to dissipate.</p>

<p>The speed at which migratory birds travel varies depending on species. Some birds can reach speeds of nearly 90 kilometres an hour, while others travel at a more sedate pace. Ducks and geese can fly between 60 and 80 kilometres an hour where herons and hawks travel at less than 40 kilometres an hour. Many smaller birds are capable of travelling at considerably faster speeds for short periods in order to escape predators, but cannot maintain these speeds for the distances required for migration. Another difference between species is that for some, the males migrate first, arriving at the breeding grounds early in order to establish territories before the female arrives to choose a suitable site for a nest.</p>

<p>One of the most impressive aspects of this migration is how birds can maintain a direction. Most migrating birds return to the same nesting areas year after year. Theories to explain precision of travelling such distances without getting lost have considered landmarks on the Earth's surface, the sun and the stars, even wind direction and an acute sense of smell. Yet these theories do not explain how some birds can travel thousands of miles on windy and wet nights and still arrive in the same area year after year.</p>

<p>Naturally, given the dangers involved, migration is a dangerous journey. Untold thousands of smaller migrants die each year from storms and attacks by predators. Mortality during migratory flight, of course, is one of the several costs that are covered by the increased production of offspring that migrants obtain by nesting in locations where food is more abundant and competition for most resources is lower. Flying at night, lighthouses, tall buildings, monuments, television towers, and other aerial obstructions have been responsible for destruction of migratory birds who simply do not detect the problem before it is too late. There is also the simple matter of exhaustion, particularly for smaller birds with less energy reserves. Birds flying for up to 48 hours straight can run into adverse winds and find the last of their energy depleted before they reach land. Flying lower and lower as fatigue sets in, these birds fall into the sea.</p>

<p>The most recent challenge to migration is, however, man. Slow climatic and environmental changes have always occurred, but not on the grand scale people have been responsible for. Extensive forests have been burned or cut away, and open fields have been claimed for agricultural purposes. Urban expansion has further encroached on the birds' natural habitats, and pollution, particularly in the form of acid rain, has damaged many of the remaining fields, mountains, lakes and forests. Wetlands that were once home to many species of birds are increasingly drained or filled as land is needed for new housing developments. After overcoming all the trials and risks involved in migration, many birds find that their homes of the year before are now unrecognisable and they are forced to find new grounds on which to breed, often straying into areas defended by larger and aggressively territorial birds.</p>

<h4>Reading Passage 3: The price of your newspaper</h4>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The average family buys two newspapers and a magazine every week, in addition to receiving up to three pieces of junk mail. Multiplied by the global population, this amounts to a lot of paper, and therefore a lot of wood. Although the rise of the home computer has gone a long way in reducing this excessive use of paper, the demand is still considerable.</p>

<p><strong>B:</strong> Social and economic concerns have over-ridden environmental common sense, and in many western countries, the woods and forests that once covered the land have long since been cleared away. A shocking example can be found by looking at the United States, which now has less than two per cent of its original forest. Other areas, predominantly tropical countries, are now following the same destructive path. In 1995 over one million hectares of forest in Brazil were cleared, a disturbing statistic but nonetheless inevitable as timber and other related raw materials are important exports for countries that often have little other way of supporting themselves. They provide employment for those who harvest the wood, extract rubber or make products using available materials. With one third of the world depending on wood for fuel, it is very tempting, though shortsighted, for poorer countries to exploit the market.</p>

<p><strong>C:</strong> It could be argued, then, that countries with rich wood resources should be fully entitled to exploit them. However, there are less destructive alternatives for generating an income from the rainforests. The forest environment provides a popular setting for ecotourism, which includes hiking, camping, bird watching and other outdoor adventure or nature study activities. International travel is becoming increasingly popular, making the rainforests accessible for the more adventurous holidaymaker.</p>

<p><strong>D:</strong> No matter what the solution, the rampant spread of deforestation has to be halted. Surveys in Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Liberia found that forest wildlife accounted for 70 to 90 per cent of the total animal protein consumed, thus arguing that some indigenous peoples are completely dependent on forests for food. In many of these countries, wood harvesting is carried out on a considerably more sensible scale. There appears to be the realisation that selling the wood is a temporary solution that would inevitably lead to worse problems for the future. Not only would the traditional food source be gone, but the trees which protected the soil against erosion would be gone. Landslides would become more common and rainwater would not be absorbed so easily into the ground, leading to a shortage of freshwater supplies. There is also the global impact, not only from the burning of the wood but also because trees provide an important role in the recycling of carbon dioxide and the production of oxygen. Estimates based on the current rate of deforestation have predicted a 15 per cent rise in the greenhouse effect around the planet.</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> In order to combat the problem of deforestation, it is important to consider its causes in greater detail. In Brazil, we should look at the unequal and unfair distribution of land – 4.5 per cent of landowners hold 81 per cent of the country's farmland, and 70 per cent of rural households are landless. With either no legal claim to the land or ownership of so much, deforestation is inevitable as land owners profit from the land. This is the point in which the situation is in the hands of government, yet often the landowners have shown their ability to sway official regulations regarding timber harvesting.</p>

<p><strong>F:</strong> To effect a serious reversal of the damage, some governments are taking a more active role in forest management to protect the environment and employment – a change which has been largely encouraged by the voting and demands of the general population which have resulted in policies of replantation and protection. As well as creating political pressure, individuals can make a difference by practising green consumerism. Recycled paper is readily available, and we can all make an effort to purchase the most ecologically sensitive products. Demanding alternative products, such as clear-cut free paper and eco-certified lumber, is important in convincing companies that markets exist for such products.</p>

<p><strong>G:</strong> None of these activities can occur without the raising of public awareness to inform consumers about the environmental effects of their products, and this is not an easy task. Many people are too entrenched in their habits or too lazy to change, yet one of the most important ways for a person to have a positive effect is to reduce his or her consumption of forest and related products. An increase in the participation of the public in, and the accessibility and productiveness of facilities for, reducing, reusing and recycling is not only necessary, but also a duty. So next time you buy a newspaper, just consider the cost.</p>]]></content:encoded>
