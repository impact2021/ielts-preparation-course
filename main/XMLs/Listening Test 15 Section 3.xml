<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<div class="transcript"><strong>Section 3</strong>

Interviewer: I’m here with today with Helen Warner, who has been a vegetarian for many years and is going to talk a little about vegetarianism. Helen, the concept of vegetarianism seems to have interested a number of our listeners, who have sent in some questions. To begin, what made you want to become a vegetarian?

Helen: Well, when I was sixteen, I had friends that were vegetarian and they introduced me to the idea. My parents were typical of their generation, and ate meat at least three or four times a week, so I didn’t really think about it too much until a few years later. It was while I was at university that I really thought about, and decided that it was unfair to eat meat when there are so many alternatives available.

Interviewer: Is there anything you miss about not eating meat?

Helen: Ummm. No, not really. As I said, there are so many substitutes available these days, perhaps the most important of which comes from the <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q24: soya bean]</strong>. Soya is so versatile, and is the staple substitute for most vegetarians.

Interviewer: So what about the nutritional value of vegetarian food? Isn’t it true that there are some vitamins that you can’t get from soya or vegetables alone. Surely people need these vitamins?

Helen: Yes, that’s correct. But actually there is only one vital vitamin that is only present in meat – that’s vitamin B12. Most vegetarians are aware of the implication of this and actually take B12 supplement in the form of tablets. Of course the way you cook vegetables is also very important in preserving vitamins. Many countries, particularly the UK, have a reputation for overcooking vegetables. Water soluble vitamins - you know, where the vitamins are dissolved into the water - are often lost. Vitamin <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q21: C]</strong> is a common example. However, this loss of vitamins can be avoided by micro waving or steaming vegetables, which is what I do whenever I cook. Some people don’t want to change their cooking habits too much, so if you do boil them simply cut down on the cooking time.

Interviewer: So a vegetarian diet is fairly healthy then?

Helen: Oh yes. A lot of people believe that vegetarianism is unhealthy, but that’s not actually the case. Vegetarians are actually considerably healthier than many meat eaters. Consider for a minute the health aspects of the incredible amount of meat this country and others like it consume. The statistics for beef eating, for example, are quite frightening. The world figure for beef consumption is slightly less than 11kg per person each year. Yet in Europe, the average consumption is nearly double that at <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q11: 21]</strong> kilos per person, and in the USA it is even worse, with the average person eating 44kg of beef every year.

Interviewer: So are you suggesting that people stop eating meat altogether and everyone adopts a vegetarian lifestyle?

Helen: No, not at all. Even in the healthiest diets there is still a place for meat, but it should be eaten in moderation. Many nutritionalists think of foods in terms of a pyramid, with the foods we can eat relatively freely at the bottom and the foods we should carefully restrict at the top. The majority of our diet should be composed of <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q27: cereals]</strong>, which would go on the bottom row of the pyramid. In this category could also be included such things as rice and pasta. Next, a good diet is followed by a roughly equal amount of vegetables and fruit. I try to have at least two servings a day of fruit and vegetable whenever possible. In decreasing quantities, you can then eat <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q28: dairy]</strong> foods – eggs, cheese etc. Almost at the top of the food pyramid comes fish - carefully prepared of course, not dripping in oil or batter! – and <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q29: white meat]</strong>. Chicken, for example, is a comparatively healthy meat, but again, a lot of this comes down to preparation methods. Right at the top of the pyramid come the ingredients of far too many western meals – <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q30: red meat]</strong> and potatoes. It is particularly in this area that I would suggest moderation.

Interviewer: Well, thank you very much Helen. I’m sure that a lot of listeners are interested in your views. How could they find out more about the health benefits of vegetarian options?

Helen: Well there are lots of websites and books on healthy eating and vegetarianism, but it is always important to remember to consult your doctor before making any radical changes to your diet or lifestyle.</div>]]></wp:meta_value>
