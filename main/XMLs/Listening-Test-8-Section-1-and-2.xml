Which TWO of the following does the chef say are true of the herb oregano?

A It's easy to sprinkle on food

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Good morning. My friend gave me your number because he says you have an house for rent and I was wondering if it was still available? I'm new to the city – I've only been here for 5 days, but I really need to find somewhere more permanent to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, it is available, but we already have some people who are booked to come and see it tomorrow afternoon. We would like to find someone to rent the house by <strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, so we don't have much time. Would you be free tomorrow to come and look at it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh, no, sorry, not tomorrow... I start my new job tomorrow, you see. How about if I come over <strong><em>this afternoon</em></strong> though, if you're free?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, that's fine. We live nearby anyway, so that's no problem. Now before you come, I think I should just let you know a few details about the house. First of all, there's not much furniture in the place. There is a sofa and some chairs, and there is a kitchen table, but that's about it. You'll probably need <strong><em>a bed</em></strong> at least. I have a spare bedside table which you can use if you like, but it's not in the house at the moment.  There is a telephone line though, and an internet connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Great, that sounds absolutely fine. My friend says he has some furniture I can have. Can I just check a few more things with you now, on the phone, before I come over and see you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Sure, go ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">So it's a three bedroom house with a kitchen, dining room and living room, is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, that's right. There are <strong><em>two bathrooms</em></strong> – one is connected to the main bedroom, and the other is downstairs.  Out the back there is a small garden which you can use, but you have to keep it neat and tidy. The grass will need to be cut at least once every few weeks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh, OK. Is there room for a table and chairs outside, do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Oh yes, the garden is <strong><em>just over 4 metres long</em></strong>, so there'll be plenty of room.</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Great.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%"> Where exactly is the apartment block? My friend said it was in Fernhill, but he didn't know the street it was on. I have actually just got a job working in Fernhill, so I was looking for somewhere to live that was within walking distance.</td>

<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">It's on Cavendish Drive, number 103</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Is that near the supermarket on Smith Lane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">No, not quite, but I can give you directions from the supermarket if that helps?</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh, yes please. I'm having some problems with my phone so I can't get the directions from the internet.</td>

<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">No problem. As you come out of the supermarket, you will see the <strong><em>post office just opposite.</em></strong></td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh yes, I know where that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Well, turn left just as you come out of the supermarket and go past Albert Park. At the end of the road, just after the park you'll see James Street. Turn right and go up James Street past <strong><em>Hill Park</em></strong> on the left and you'll see a…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">I didn't know there was another park!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, it's very nice. It's just opposite the Mainland Bank. Anyway, go past the park and take the second road on the right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">That's opposite Davis Lane isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">No, that's the <em>first</em> right– that's <strong><em>Wood Lane</em></strong>. You need to take the second right, so go past Wood Lane until you see a row of houses on the left and a <strong><em>petrol station</em></strong> on the right. The petrol station is actually on the corner of James Street and Cavendish Drive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">OK, I think I know where you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Great. Now turn right from James Street onto Cavendish Drive, walk past the hairdressers and you'll see another row of houses. Number 103 is the last one in the row. There's a <strong><em>bus stop</em></strong> just past the house, so if you get to the bus stop, you've gone too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">That's great – thanks very much. So I'll see you this afternoon.</td>

<strong>Section 2</strong>

Thanks for joining us... It is a pleasure to be here with you in Canada. Actually my first visit to your amazing country. Now for our cooking demonstration today, I'm going to show you how to make a main chicken dish which is a healthy meal but allows you to keep preparation time and washing up to a minimum!  With a few slight alterations the dish could serve quite well at an adult dinner party or as part of as a family dinner.

First of all, you'll need to pre-heat your oven as evenly as possible to 180 degrees Celsius. Now you'll need one chicken breast per dinner guest – these should be skinless, boneless and trimmed nicely. Place the chicken pieces in a medium depth oven dish with the thicker sides together.

Remember that using the fan on the oven is a useful way of distributing heat as evenly as possible, but a fan will cause your oven to be slightly hotter at the front than the back. For this reason put the thinner parts of the chicken towards the back of the dish and the oven so that your chicken pieces are more likely to cook evenly with the thicker parts at the front in the warmer part of the oven...

Once you've got your chicken laid out in your dish, sprinkle oregano generously over the chicken. You know, <strong>oregano is such a useful herb</strong> and interestingly enough its dried form is usually more full of flavour than when it is fresh. <strong>It's a fantastic flavouring for many different types of meat dishes and is a staple herb used in Greek and Italian cookery.</strong> Oregano has an aromatic, warm but slightly bitter taste – it goes really well with lemony flavours which we will soon also add to this particular dish.

The next thing that you need to do is add the lemon. Now you can just squeeze the lemon juice out over the top of the chicken, but even better is to grate the outside of the lemon and to add what we call the zest from the rind – this gives a much zestier, rounded flavour which is a fantastic accompaniment to the oregano.]]></wp:meta_value>
