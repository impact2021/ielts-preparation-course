<td width="75%">Good morning. My friend gave me your number because he says you have an house for rent and I was wondering if it was still available? I’m new to the city – I’ve only been here for 5 days, but I really need to find somewhere more permanent to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, it is available, but we already have some people who are booked to come and see it tomorrow afternoon. We would like to find someone to rent the house by <strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, so we don’t have much time. Would you be free tomorrow to come and look at it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh, no, sorry, not tomorrow... I start my new job tomorrow, you see. How about if I come over <strong><em>this afternoon</em></strong> though, if you’re free?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, that’s fine. We live nearby anyway, so that’s no problem. Now before you come, I think I should just let you know a few details about the house. First of all, there’s not much furniture in the place. There is a sofa and some chairs, and there is a kitchen table, but that’s about it. You’ll probably need <strong><em>a bed</em></strong> at least. I have a spare bedside table which you can use if you like, but it’s not in the house at the moment.  There is a telephone line though, and an internet connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Great, that sounds absolutely fine. My friend says he has some furniture I can have. Can I just check a few more things with you now, on the phone, before I come over and see you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Sure, go ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">So it’s a three bedroom house with a kitchen, dining room and living room, is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Yes, that’s right. There are <strong><em>two bathrooms</em></strong> – one is connected to the main bedroom, and the other is downstairs.  Out the back there is a small garden which you can use, but you have to keep it neat and tidy. The grass will need to be cut at least once every few weeks.</td>

<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">Oh, OK. Is there room for a table and chairs outside, do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Oh yes, the garden is <strong><em>just over 4 metres long</em></strong>, so there’ll be plenty of room.</td>

<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>

<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">No, not quite, but I can give you directions from the supermarket if that helps?</td>

<td width="75%">Oh, yes please. I’m having some problems with my phone so I can’t get the directions from the internet.</td>

<td width="75%">Oh yes, I know where that is.</td>

<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">I didn’t know there was another park!</td>

<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">That’s opposite Davis Lane isn’t it?</td>

<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">No, that’s the <em>first</em> right– that’s <strong><em>Wood Lane</em></strong>. You need to take the second right, so go past Wood Lane until you see a row of houses on the left and a <strong><em>petrol station</em></strong> on the right. The petrol station is actually on the corner of James Street and Cavendish Drive.</td>

<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">OK, I think I know where you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Apartment owner</td>
<td width="75%">Great. Now turn right from James Street onto Cavendish Drive, walk past the hairdressers and you’ll see another row of houses. Number 103 is the last one in the row. There’s a <strong><em>bus stop</em></strong> just past the house, so if you get to the bus stop, you’ve gone too far.</td>

<tr>
<td width="25%">Potential tenant</td>
<td width="75%">That’s great – thanks very much. So I’ll see you this afternoon.</td>

<strong>Section 2</strong>

Thanks for joining us... It is a pleasure to be here with you in Canada. Actually my first visit to your amazing country. Now for our cooking demonstration today, I’m going to show you how to make a main chicken dish which is a healthy meal but allows you to keep preparation time and washing up to a minimum!  With a few slight alterations the dish could serve quite well at an adult dinner party or as part of as a family dinner.

First of all, you’ll need to pre-heat your oven as evenly as possible to 180 degrees Celsius. Now you’ll need one chicken breast per dinner guest – these should be skinless, boneless and trimmed nicely. Place the chicken pieces in a medium depth oven dish with the thicker sides together.

Remember that using the fan on the oven is a useful way of distributing heat as evenly as possible, but a fan will cause your oven to be slightly hotter at the front than the back. For this reason put the thinner parts of the chicken towards the back of the dish and the oven so that your chicken pieces are more likely to cook evenly with the thicker parts at the front in the warmer part of the oven...

Once you’ve got your chicken laid out in your dish, sprinkle oregano generously over the chicken. You know, oregano is such a useful herb and interestingly enough its dried form is usually more full of flavour than when it is fresh. It’s a fantastic flavouring for many different types of meat dishes and is a staple herb used in Greek and Italian cookery. Oregano has an aromatic, warm but slightly bitter taste – it goes really well with lemony flavours which we will soon also add to this particular dish.

The next thing that you need to do is add the lemon. Now you can just squeeze the lemon juice out over the top of the chicken, but even better is to grate the outside of the lemon and to add what we call the zest from the rind – this gives a much zestier, rounded flavour which is a fantastic accompaniment to the oregano.

Next, slice up some cheese – and add it to your baking dish. The best type of cheese for this kind of dish is feta cheese – most people have tried feta at some point, but if you are not familiar it is a semi-soft cheese traditionally made in Greece, Turkey and other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, very easy to get these days and its available in several varieties in most supermarkets in Canada. Cut the cheese into generous chunks – maybe two or three per person is a good guideline and place them in the dish with your meat.

Then, drizzle some olive oil on top of the chicken pieces and the cheese to aid their browning - and the final thing you need to add before you put them in the oven is a sprinkling of black pepper. Since feta is a salty cheese you should not add any extra salt before cooking, but you may wish to put a salt cellar on the table for guests who have a preference for saltier foods.

The dish will take around 25 minutes to cook. Remember to make sure that the meat is cooking evenly and turn the dish part way through cooking if necessary.

For serving at a dinner party I would suggest that you serve with olives, salad and garlic bread. For a family meal you could serve with potatoes or rice and freshly steamed vegetables.

Chicken is an excellent source of protein and a rich source of most B vitamins. However, chicken skin is high in saturated fat and should be removed before eating as we have done for this recipe. We’ve used white chicken breast here – it could be replaced by thighs if you prefer but remember darker meat is higher in fat. If you find it hard to cook chicken correctly though, chicken thighs can be useful to use instead of the white meat as they are less likely to dry out if you overcook them.

Well, I hope that you and your family and dinner guests enjoy this dish – in the next session we are going to look a preparation of a main meal involving salmon.]]></wp:meta_value>
