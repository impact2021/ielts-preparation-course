<h2>Amnesia</h2>

<p>Medical science has made some amazing discoveries over the past century. Nerves can be repaired, skin can be grafted, organs can be replaced. Advancements in the field of psychology are no less impressive, as it is now possible to diagnose and treat a number of mental illnesses. Yet there is a gap in our knowledge, a condition which has as yet defied true understanding and consequently any form of effective treatment – amnesia. Sufferers of amnesia find themselves unable to recall or remember past experiences, even to the point of not knowing the names of their own family.</p>

<p>In order to understand how amnesia affects us, it is important to understand how our memories are stored. Physiologically speaking, a memory is the result of chemical or even structural changes in synaptic transmissions between neurons. As these changes occur, a pathway is created. This pathway is called a memory trace. Signals can travel along these memory traces through the brain. Making and storing memories is a complex process involving many regions of the brain, including the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, and it is damage or disease to these areas that results in varying degrees of memory loss. For this reason, it is common for people with head injuries to experience at least some degree of amnesia. For those amnesiacs who recover, older memories are generally recalled first, and then more recent memories, until almost all memory is recovered. Memories of events that occurred around the time of the accident or onset of amnesia are sometimes never recovered.</p>

<p>Though we may be some way from a cure, research has allowed us to at least identify the problem areas. Amnesia is an umbrella term covering memory loss in general and there are a number of specific types depending on related causes, different causes or symptoms. This condition may result from health problems or events in life, such as an accident. It may result from damage to the brain from injuries, including head injury, stroke, or a result of disease, such as alcohol, or chronic drug abuse or psychological trauma or stress. For each of these causes, there is a distinct form of amnesia.</p>

<p>Anterograde amnesia is characterised by a complete recall of events that occurred before the trauma or disease that caused the amnesia, but an inability to retain new memories since that time. Retrograde amnesia is the opposite, in which short-term memory functions perfectly well, but events or experiences from before the trauma or disease can no longer be recalled. Transient global amnesia is perhaps the most frightening, as there is as yet no consistently identifiable cause. Some theorists have suggested that it could be the result of small strokes which can occur when a blockage in an artery temporarily prevents oxygen supply to part of the brain. Others argue that intense migraines could be a significant factor. Both theories base themselves on the fact that this amnesia is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people. Characterised by sudden confusion and forgetfulness, this generally lasts between half an hour and 24 hours, although in severe attacks a victim can become completely disoriented and may briefly experience retrograde amnesia that extends back several years. While very frightening for the patient, transient global amnesia has the highest rate of total recovery.</p>

<p>Amnesia can also manifest itself in other, more specific, forms such as lacunar amnesia, in which a specific event is blocked or erased from memory. This is a fairly common form of amnesia, most often occurring after a particular harrowing or emotionally difficult event or experience. On a similar note, temporary memory loss can be induced through psychological trauma leading the victim to suffer from emotional or hysterical amnesia. There are some forms of amnesia that are self-induced. Korsakoff syndrome, familiar in its mildest form to many, is memory loss stemming from excessive alcohol consumption. In extreme cases of alcohol abuse, days or even weeks of memory may disappear.</p>

<p>Diagnosing amnesia and its cause is still far from an exact science. If amnesia is suspected, patients undergo a physical examination during which doctors look at several factors. During a physical examination, the doctor enquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug and medication history, and checks the patient's general health. For cases where a problem appears to be manifesting itself, psychological examination may be able to determine the extent of amnesia and the memory system affected. The brain can also be scanned to reveal any evidence of damage, and blood can be tested to check for any diseases that may be present. Yet it should be remembered that for the most part, amnesia is often temporary and very limited. Some types of amnesia, such as transient global amnesia, are completely resolved and there is no permanent loss of memory. Others, such as Korsakoff syndrome, may be permanent, but no matter what the cause, a degree of rehabilitation is almost always possible.</p>";}}]]></wp:meta_value>
