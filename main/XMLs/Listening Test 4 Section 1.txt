<strong>Section 1</strong>

W<strong>:   </strong>Hi, I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the renovations and changes made to the city Art Gallery.  It shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes.

M:   Five minutes?  Ok, that shouldn’t be too long.  Sure, what do you want to know?

W:  Well, one of the things we want to know is how often people visit the Art Gallery, and if they visit more than once a year?How many times would you say you come to the Art Gallery?

M:  Oh, I’d say it depends, it depends on what exhibitions are on, usually more than once a year, probably <u>2 or 3 times</u>.  I do like art, but I don’t come 4 times, haven’t usually got the time.

W:  And what section do you like to visit?

M:  Well, I do like the Old Master’s, it’s always the first section I see.  Not too keen on Modern Art.  I might have a quick look, and I usually see what sculptures they’ve added, but I always like to spend time with the Van Goghs and other <u>classics</u>.

W:  I see.  Do you follow our publicity about new exhibitions?  New shows?

M:  Well, not so much new exhibitions, but I do read any info on upcoming <u>talks</u>, when you have a speaker, especially aboutthe painters themselves.

W:  Ok, thank you.  Now, one other area I’d like to look at is the Shop.  Do you ever visit the Shop in the museum?

M:  Oh, yes, every time I go.

W:  And what, if anything, do you buy?  What are you interested in?

M:  Well, I always look at the books, especially the new ones.  And I always <u>buy a calendar</u>, I like to give them as gifts.  And, then, I usually check out any souvenirs, or small items.  Anything new.

W:  Ok, thank you very much for that.

&nbsp;

W:  Now, if you don’t mind, can I just get a little bit of personal information, you don’t have to answer all of the questions,if you don’t want to.

M:  Sure.  No problem.

W:  Well, I don’t need your name, but can I ask your age group?  For example, are you 20-35, 36-50, or over 50?

M:  Well, not quite a senior citizen, I’m in the <u>36 to 50 </u>age group.

W:  And can I ask your profession?  Your job?

M:  Yes, I teach at City College.  I’m an Economics <u>teacher.</u>

W:  And can you tell me what part of the city you live in?  The outskirts, the suburbs, the inner city?

M:  Well, we can walk to the Gallery, so, I guess you could say we live in the <u>city centre</u>.

W:  And, finally, you seem to be happy with the Art Gallery, but if you could, what changes or improvements would you like to see at the Gallery?

M:  Hmm, that’s a good question.  Well, I’m pretty happy with the number of exhibits in general, and the range is good, butpossibly, the exhibitions could be changed, you know, <u>new exhibits more often</u>.

W:  Ok, I’ll note that.

M:  The location is good, easy to walk to and there is good convenient parking nearby.  One thing, though, maybe a <u>café or</u> <u>coffee shop</u>.  I know you can get a drink or snack in the shop, but I’d like some place to sit and relax and really be able to take in the experience.

W:  Ok, that’s all good information.  Thank you, I’ll take note of that.  Now, if we can just…
