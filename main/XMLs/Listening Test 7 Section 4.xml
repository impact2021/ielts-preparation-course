<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<div class="transcript"><strong>Section 4</strong>

Norfolk island is a small island in the Pacific Ocean which lies between Australia, <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q37: New Zealand]</strong> and New Caledonia. Norfolk Island and two neighbouring islands – Phillip Island and Nepean Island which form one of Australia’s external territories.

<span class="answers">(Q31) Although a territory of Australia, Norfolk island has its own <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q31: flag]</strong></span>, on which can be seen a green pine tree – this being representative of an evergreen tree native to Norfolk island itself. <span class="answers">(Q32) Today, the island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance.</span> The island is subject to separate immigration controls to the rest of Australia and<span class="answers"> (Q33) a certain amount of <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q33: controversy]</strong> surrounds its territory status to this day </span>– some islanders insisting that in fact the island had been granted independence by Queen Victoria in the 1800s.

Before the Europeans arrived, Norfolk Island <span class="answers">was first settled by East Polynesian seafarers either from the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand or from the North Island of New Zealand. They arrived in the (Q34) <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q34: fourteenth or fifteenth]</strong> century</span>, and inhabited the island for several generations before they disappeared – to this day the reasons for their demise remain a mystery.

Captain James Cook, was the first European to sight the island which he did in 1774, on his second voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Resolution.
<span class="answers">(Q35) The abundance of <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q35: trees]</strong> – as depicted on the island’s flag -was one of the major points of interest to be discovered by Northern Hemisphere explorers. </span>

Cook christened the island in honour of the <span class="answers">(Q36) Duchess of Norfolk back in the UK – as it turned out, one year after the Duchess had actually died</span>; since Cook had set out from England in 1772, he was <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q36: unaware]</strong> of her death which had already occurred in May 1773.

On Tuesday 11 October 1774, for the first time, Cook went on shore to Norfolk Island and is said to have been impressed with the tall straight trees and New Zealand flax plants. He took samples back to the United Kingdom and reported on their potential uses for the Royal Navy. At that time, finding new sources of flax – which was used for ship sails and timber for ship masts – was crucially important to allow the United Kingdom to continue its control of ocean going activities. Captain Cook reported that <span class="answers">(Q37) Norfolk Island had the second most plentiful supply of wood and mast timber in the south seas after New Zealand.</span>

<span class="answers">What made Norfolk island a particularly attractive prospect to the British in conjunction with its plentiful supply of trees and flax was its lack of a (Q38) <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q38: native population]</strong></span>; there was therefore no one present to oppose colonisation unlike in New Zealand where opposition was a certainty from the native Maori population. Since however, the island was so small, (it has an area of 34.6 km2) the decision was taken for a dual colonization alongside New South Wales – the connection to Australia being therefore established.

Today, most Islanders are of either European-only or combined European-Tahitian ancestry, being descendants of the Bounty mutineers as well as more recent arrivals from Australia and New Zealand.<span class="answers">(Q39) </span><span class="answers"><strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q39: About half]</strong> of the islanders can trace their roots back to Pitcairn Island</span>.

The population of Norfolk Island was estimated in July 2003 to be 1,853, 20.2% of the population were 14 years and under, 63.9% were 15 to 64 years and 15.9% were 65 years and over. Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk, which is in essence a blend of 1700s English and Tahitian. The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons; however, there are efforts to keep it alive through published dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents.

Emigration is growing as many Islanders choose to move to Australia or New Zealand. There is only one school on the island which provides education to Australian Year 12. However, any student wishing to go on to university or another form of tertiary study must travel overseas as no such institutions exist on the island. <span class="answers">(Q40) Many skilled workers now also elect to move overseas to pursue increased economic <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q40: opportunities]</strong> in bigger centres.</span>

Nowadays, the main economy of the island is tourism and a ban on the import of fruit and vegetables helps to ensure that agriculture remains fairly robust.</div>]]></wp:meta_value>
