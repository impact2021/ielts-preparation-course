<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>

<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Yes, that’s the one. The registration number is ZK3772.</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks. Now, if you can describe the accident to me, I can make a note of it and start your claim.</td>

<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks. Well, all I did was reverse into the corner of my garage. My fault, but it has caused some damage to the back of the car.</td>

<td width="76">Customer:</td>

<td width="540">Yes, but only the lights on the passenger’s side.</td>

<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Actually, the problem is the boot won’t open. I think it’s bent so it seems stuck now.</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">No problem – we aim to get our customers’ vehicles repaired and returned within 7 days wherever possible, but it sounds like the repairs to your vehicle should only take two days.  The next step is to take the car for a closer inspection.</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Just let me have a look... yes, they are on our list, so that’s no problem at all. Just take your car to them and ask them to prepare a quotation for the repairs. When they give you a written quotation, you should fax or post it to us as soon as possible. If our insurance assessors agree with the costs, we will contact Kane’s Automotive immediately to begin work on your car.</td>

<td width="540">And if your assessor says the costs are too high?</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>

<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">That’s good. I will need my car back as soon as possible. At the moment, I am being collected by a work colleague but he will be away next week so I’ll have to find my own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, I have some good news for you – as you have our Gold Standard insurance policy, you are entitled to a loan car for the duration of the repairs, so you’ll be mobile again as soon as you take your car to the garage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Oh, that’s great! I didn’t realise that. In that case, there’s not so much rush to get the job completed.</td>

<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, we’re glad that helps. So, as soon as your car is at the mechanics and you have received a quotation, let us know and we will get your car repaired as soon as possible.</td>
