<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Yes, I raise them in the house and they’re very good with other dogs and children. My grandson plays with them all the time. They’re still very young remember, so they’ll adapt really easily to living in a household with children around full-time. Just remember to tell your little girl to be very gentle, especially at first.</td>

<td valign="top" width="76%">How old are they now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">They’re seven weeks old. I let them go when they are 8 weeks or older, so they’ll be available for their owners to take home in (Q2) one week.</td>

<td valign="top" width="24%">Customer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">How about on Thursday – the day after tomorrow. Would it be okay if I come at around 10.30am?</td>

<td valign="top" width="76%">157 Westlands Rd - isn’t Westland Rd near Barnett Drive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Yes, it is. (Q5/6) After the traffic lights, you come along Barnett Drive and you’ll see a fruit and vegetable shop on the left hand side. Just after that you’ll see a craft shop. Go past the craft shop and you’ll see a cafe on your right. Take the second right after the cafe – that’s Westlands Rd, it’s the one after Banks Drive.</td>

<td valign="top" width="24%">Customer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">I have another question for you. I’m thinking of getting the puppy micro-chipped, so that if it gets lost it could be easily traced and returned to us. Do you think that’s a good idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Yes, I do. There are many advantages to micro-chipping when you compare it to other forms of identification. Collars and tags can be convenient but they’re also easily taken off or (Q7) lost. Micro-chipping is permanent. In very rare cases you might have a situation where the microchip moves in the dog’s body so it can’t be found and scanned, but you can always have the chip checked every now and then to make sure it’s still working properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Customer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Does it hurt the dog? When they put the microchip in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">No. The microchip is really small, roughly the size of a grain of (Q8) rice. Because it’s so small it makes it easy for the vet to put in; it can be easily injected between the shoulder blades of even the smallest dog. The dog being injected rarely notices any discomfort for more than a few (Q9) seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Customer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Are there any risks involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Breeder:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">There’s a very small risk of infection – but you can minimise this by just taking a bit of extra care of the area for a while – make sure it doesn’t get (Q10) dirty – that sort of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="24%">Customer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="76%">Well thanks for that advice, it gives us something to think about. I’ll see you soon then - we’re looking forward to meeting you and of course the puppies!</td>

<strong>SECTION 2</strong>
<strong>Section 2 </strong>

Good afternoon. I’m James Harrison and welcome to “Your Hometown”, the programme where we explore a place near you.

Today we’re going to visit Quartztown, one of the busiest little towns in the country. Situated on the wild remote southwest coast, Quartztown is set amongst stunning scenery with a backdrop of towering mountains and lush forests.  Although it wasn’t established before the eighteenth century, it’s packed in a lot of action since then.

Quartstown was first founded by gold miners who discovered the precious metal in the Rift River in 1860. At the height of the gold rush Quartztown boasted a population of 26,000. In 1865 there were more than 100 pubs and just 1 library. Once the gold rush was over the town settled into a quieter but just as prosperous era. In 1873 the railway reached Quartztown connecting it to the capital city, Warrington. This development enabled the growth of agriculture in the gentle valleys of the coastal region in the twentieth century. The main economic activities became forestry, farming, fishing and coal mining. The Delmer coalmine is the largest opencast mine in the country and provides employment to 32% of Quartztown’s working age population.

The town experienced a decline in population in the last couple of decades of the twentieth century owing to developments in the traditional primary industries. For example, dairy farming has become less labour intensive with larger herd sizes and the greater mechanisation of farming processes. This led to decline in the population numbers with many young people moving away to pursue employment opportunities. However, there has been a dramatic reversal of the town’s fortunes in the last two decades with tourism and outdoor activities drawing huge numbers of tourists and thrill seekers into the area.

Since 1994 Quartztown has hosted a midwinter festival which brings thousands of visitors to the town. Celebrating the longest night of the year, the midwinter festival kicks off with a colourful parade of vividly costumed characters. Music is provided by bands from the town’s high school, the army base and local musicians. Many local businesses sponsor floats in the parade which usually feature themes relating to the district and its history. Interactive light displays are staged at various locations, with vibrant projections screened onto local buildings and monuments. And the night ends with a magnificent fireworks display designed by the world famous pyrotechnician, Waldo Emerson.

The parade heralds two weeks of celebration.  A skating rink is installed in the town’s main square and every night during the festival parties will be held at the rink with music mixed by the internationally renowned DJ, Soulbass. The Quartztown alpine ski and board competition is run at nearby Mt Davenport. Events include the giant slalom, downhill and freestyle skiing.  Also on the mountain is a “bikes on snow” event, where mountain bikers engage in a thrilling downhill race. The Long Neck marathon which attracts competitors from around the globe is staged in the stunning Long Neck Valley. All these competitions have been generously supported by international and local sponsors. For the less sports minded there is also a craft fair, a readers’ and writers’ event which is usually attended by the year’s Man Booker prize winner and concerts by the Warrington Symphony Orchestra. Visitors can also take either walking or horse-back tours of the historical gold mining areas, and even try their hands at panning for gold. There’s a lot going on.

We are going to go now to the town’s mayor, Maisie Bates, for her view of this year’s midwinter festival.

<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">However much we might try not to, we often judge others on their appearance. For our seminar today, we have ‘face reading’ expert Dr Juliet Bryans who is going to tell us just how accurate impressions based upon appearance may or may not be. Welcome Dr Bryans. To many of us ‘face reading' may be an unfamiliar concept... can you give us some background please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Thank you for inviting me... Well, I’ll start by saying that the science of reading facial features has been around for some time! It’s actually an ancient Asian art that hails from China. (Q21) It would most often be used to diagnose health related issues... for example even to non-medics dark circles under someone’s eyes tells us that they are tired or have not slept properly... or red blotches arising from broken capillaries can often be due to over indulgence in (Q22) spicy food or indeed alcohol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Am I correct in saying though that a newer philosophy is the study of relationships between facial features and our likely behaviour and personality traits. I find this particular aspect of face reading to be all the more fascinating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Yes that’s true. We have been conducting research into this at our institute for the last 5 years. For example, studies have shown that individuals with more rounded faces – you know, chubbier faces, and with larger and fuller mouths are likely to be more interested in socialising than people with more angular, square facial features. The latter are more likely to be focussed upon (Q23) being efficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Imagine then being greeted by two receptionists with these different physical characteristics. So could we expect (Q24) the one with the rounder features to typically be friendlier than the one with more angular features?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Yes according to the theories that would be the case, though in contrast the person with the squarer features could also be expected to process your enquiry more efficiently due to their practical focus on the task at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">So is it easy to categorise people into behavioural groups based upon how they look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Not really....Of course people tend to be a mixture of different things and it is possible to look at an individual’s face and see that they (Q25) possess physical characteristics which show both the ability to be sociable and get along with others alongside possession of more practical skills. For example, (Q26) a person may possess very bright, sparkling, welcoming eyes – ideal for communicating and working with others, but may also have a squared angular chin a sure sign of that person being practical and having a lot of common sense. These kinds of people have the ability to get people on their side and to encourage cooperation with their points of view, whilst also being very determined to achieve their own goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">It seems that there is often quite a logical connection between looks and behaviour then...? I mean, it seems natural that someone with bright warm eyes, is likely to be friendly and welcoming....</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">(Q27) Yes that true....Very delicate facial features... such as a long thin nose or high delicate cheekbones can give a person a frail and soft physical appearance. There also seems to be a correlation to a sensitive personality – (Q28a) someone who looks like this may have a tendency to be easily emotionally hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">That’s interesting.... moving back to the eyes, I think they are one of the easier features for an ordinary person to read about another person. The eyes tell us so much about health, mood and character I think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">True... and their shape can also tell us a lot. The eyes and the way in which they slope up or down can also be a sign of emotional vulnerability. According to our studies those with (Q28b) eyes that slope downwards in the inner corners should be great at communication but may be easily hurt by others.  People with upward sloping eyes are often optimists who spend their lives taking advantage of what life has to offer..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">This is so interesting. What other feature would you say is an easy one for novice face readers to look out for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Dr Bryans:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Foreheads... now foreheads are a good indicator of how a person may think or learn. A high forehead indicates that person is (Q29/30) highly analytical and has a strong interest in learning and (Q29/30) studying using books – many academics have larger foreheads.... In contrast a short forehead indicates that that person is more likely to learn more by carrying out activities – learning tasks practically rather than reading about them. There are so many characteristics for experts to consider – it’s a very interesting exercise to have your own photograph analysed and you are likely to be surprised by just how accurate descriptions can be – believe me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Interviewer:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">That’s a great insight! Thanks for that, now after the break we are going to open the floor to questions....</td>

<strong>SECTION 4</strong>
<strong>Section 4</strong>

Good afternoon I’m Jake Ackerman and I’m going to talk to you today about a Twentieth century architectural movement, the Bauhaus which has had a profound impact on contemporary design.

The term, <em>Bauhaus</em>, in German means ‘house construction’ or ‘art of building’, but it also alludes to<em> Bauhutt</em>, the name of a medieval stonemasons guild. Originally the Staatliches Bauhaus, to give it its full name, was an art school set up by German architect, Walter Gropius. Gropius had previously been appointed director of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar in 1915. Under Gropius the school was merged with the Weimar Academy of Fine Art in 1919 to become the Bauhaus.

As the previous name of the school suggests it had been inspired by the English Arts and Crafts movement lead by William Morris, who advocated traditional craftsmanship and the use of simple forms with no distinction between function and form. Another influence on the Bauhaus was the Russian Constructivist art and design movement which saw art as a social practice and not one that is divorced from all other aspects of life. The most important cultural movement shaping the Bauhaus, however, was Modernism, which rejected traditional and classical art and design practices as irrelevant to the modern industrial world. This quest to merge art and design with functionality led Gropius to state that the Bauhaus ‘strives to collect all artistic creativity into a unity, to reunite all artistic disciplines – sculpture, painting, design and handicraft – into a new architecture”.

Ironically perhaps, the Bauhaus was originally intended to be a school which combined architecture with art and craft but in the first few years of the school there were no architecture classes.  What architectural output there was, was produced by Gropius and his architectural partner Adolf Meyer. Among the first members of the faculty were eminent artists, including sculptor Gerhard Marcks and painters Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.  The programme was both experimental and theoretical. The initial curriculum included a foundation course in the first year where students were introduced to colour theory and basic principles of design. The students also experimented with many materials and processes. This was followed by a further 2 years of design specialisation.

Gradually, by the early 1920s, the Bauhaus style was moving away from traditional craftwork and leaning more towards functional modern design which suited the new industrial age. Gropius, who remained the director until 1928, set out to produce beautiful functional objects which anyone could afford. One example of this was his F-51 chair which he designed for the Bauhaus director’s room.  Its boxy, cantilevered form is like a piece of sculpture and it remains timelessly modern even after almost one 100 years. It is emblematic of Gropius’ state-of-art construction techniques.

By this time the fundamentals of the Bauhaus style were emerging. Sparse and undecorated, Bauhaus architecture favoured the functional and asymmetrical. Typically cubic, sometimes curved and open plan, with smooth facades in a single primary colour, usually white. This style became also known as the International Style.

The city of Weimar had long been the seat of artistic endeavour, having been the home of the German Enlightenment in the 18th century. It drew musicians, artists and writers throughout the 19th century and after World War I it became the site of the new democratic republic of Weimar. In this period it thrived as a liberal centre of arts and culture. However by 1924 with the rise of conservative political pressures the Bauhaus’ funding was halved and the staff given short term contracts. Gropius closed the school in Weimar and offered the school up to other cities.

Gropius chose the industrial city of Dessau as it commissioned him to design and build his own school. The city provided funding and a development site for the building as well as another for three semi-detached houses for faculty members. The city remains the owner of both these properties. In 1994 the building became the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation for experimental design, research and teaching and 2 years late was declared a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.

It was at Dessau that the Bauhaus style was cemented, its architectural productivity increased and the school gained profitable commissions, particularly under the new leadership of Hannes Meyer who replaced Gropius as the head when he retired. Throughout the 1920s the school flourished, but by the beginning of the following decade, political changes meant the school was forced to close.
