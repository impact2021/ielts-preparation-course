<td width="540">Good morning, Four Star insurance. How may I help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Oh hello, I have recently crashed my car and would like to know how to go about making a claim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Certainly – I assume you have a policy with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Yes, I do. My policy number is NK 143?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks. And can you tell me your full name please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Sure it’s Jane Anne Freemont / John Andrew Freemont</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Is that F-R-E-E-M-O-U-N-T?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">No, not quite – there’s no U. It’s just F-R-E-E-M-O-N-T.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">OK, thanks. And your current address?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">It’s 14a High Road, Garlston.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">That’s great. The computer is just looking for your policy...Ah yes, here it is. I see that you have more than one vehicle insured with us. Which car was involved in the accident?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">It’s the Ford Escort; the other car is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">OK, I can see that here. It’s a 1998 model, isn’t it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Yes, that’s the one. The registration number is ZK3772.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks. Now, if you can describe the accident to me, I can make a note of it and start your claim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks. Well, all I did was reverse into the corner of my garage. My fault, but it has caused some damage to the back of the car.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, these things happen. If you can tell me what part of the back of the car is damaged, then I can make mark it on our claim forms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">The back bumper has come off, and the passenger’s side lights have broken – the ones on the driver’s side are fine. The lock on the boot has also jammed, so I can’t open it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">I see. So the bumper may need to be replaced, and the lights have broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Yes, but only the lights on the passenger’s side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Oh, OK. And did you say the boot is won’t close?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Actually, the problem is the boot won’t open. I think it’s bent so it seems stuck now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">I’ll just make a note of that too, then.</td>

<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">OK, so now have the basic details of the claim, we can start processing your application so you can get the car repaired and back on the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Great – I really need it as soon as possible because it’s the car I used for work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">No problem – we aim to get our customers’ vehicles repaired and returned within 7 days wherever possible, but it sounds like the repairs to your vehicle should only take two days.  The next step is to take the car for a closer inspection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Can I use my local garage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, that depends – you can take your vehicle to any of our preferred service mechanics. We only authorise work done by garages that are on our preferred service list, so it depends whether the garage you have in mind is on that list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">It’s Kane Automotive in Eldon Street – is that OK?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Just let me have a look... yes, they are on our list, so that’s no problem at all. Just take your car to them and ask them to prepare a quotation for the repairs. When they give you a written quotation, you should fax or post it to us as soon as possible. If our insurance assessors agree with the costs, we will contact Kane’s Automotive immediately to begin work on your car.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">And if your assessor says the costs are too high?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Then you would need to take the vehicle to another garage to obtain a second quote. Don’t worry though – because Kane’s Automotive is on our list, we don’t expect there to be any problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">That’s good. I will need my car back as soon as possible. At the moment, I am being collected by a work colleague but he will be away next week so I’ll have to find my own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, I have some good news for you – as you have our Gold Standard insurance policy, you are entitled to a loan car for the duration of the repairs, so you’ll be mobile again as soon as you take your car to the garage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Oh, that’s great! I didn’t realise that. In that case, there’s not so much rush to get the job completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Well, we’re glad that helps. So, as soon as your car is at the mechanics and you have received a quotation, let us know and we will get your car repaired as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Customer:</td>
<td width="540">Thanks very much your help. Bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="76">Insurance agent:</td>
<td width="540">Bye.</td>
