<p>There are <strong>Fill in the blank 1 of 8</strong> sections to the listening test, with <strong>Fill in the blank 2 of 8</strong> questions for each section. The recordings take about 25 minutes and then you have <strong>Fill in the blank 3 of 8</strong> minutes to transfer your answers to the answer paper. You will have only <strong>Fill in the blank 4 of 8</strong> chance to hear the recordings except for the example given at the beginning of the test. The recordings will pause briefly for about 20 seconds for you to read the next set of questions, except for in section <strong>Fill in the blank 5 of 8</strong>, when the recording will play right through with only a few seconds break in the middle.</p>

<p>In sections 1 and 2, the recording has a social or semi-formal focus. In sections 3 and 4, the topic is more academic or educational. In Sections 2 and 4 you will generally only have <strong>Fill in the blank 6 of 8</strong> main speaker.</p>

<p>There are a number of points you should keep in mind when writing your answers. Your <strong>Fill in the blank 7 of 8</strong> must be correct (words spelled incorrectly will be marked wrong). You should always keep to the word <strong>Fill in the blank 8 of 8</strong> given in the instructions. Writing more words than specified means that your answer will be marked wrong.</p>";}}]]></wp:meta_value>
