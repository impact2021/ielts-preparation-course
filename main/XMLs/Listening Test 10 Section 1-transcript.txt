<strong><u>Woman:  </u></strong><u>Good morning, Fairview Real Estate Agency.  How can I help you?</u>

<strong><u>Man:   </u></strong><u>Yes, good morning, I’m phoning about some properties that you’re advertising…</u>

<strong><u>W:   </u></strong><u>Ok, are you thinking of buying, or <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q4: <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q5: a]</strong>]</strong> rental property?</u>

<strong><u>M:</u></strong><u>   To rent…, I want to rent a house.</u>

<strong>W:  </strong>Ok, well…,    we have a number of properties for rent.  Do you know the general area you’re interested in?

<strong>M:</strong>   Yes, we’d like to be on the north side of the city, but close to the downtown area, or at least with good public transportation.

<strong>W:   </strong>Alright, yes, we have some nice houses in Northbridge, that’s a great area.  Are you looking for a house or an apartment?

<strong>M:   </strong>A house.  It’s for my wife and I, and our son.  He’s starting school this year, so that’s another requirement…, we’d like to be near a <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q2: primary]</strong> school, if we could.

<strong>W:   </strong>That shouldn’t be a problem. There are a couple of good schools in Northbridge, and also in Meadowvale, which is the next suburb.  What kind of house are you looking for?

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, three bedrooms, I want to set up an office in the third bedroom.  I do a lot of work from home you see.

<strong>W:   </strong>Ok.

<strong>M:   </strong>Oh, and a garage…, a 2-car garage, if possible.

<strong>W:   </strong>Alright.  I’ll type that into the computer and see what we have.  Do you have any other requirements?

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, of course we want a kitchen and living area, but we would also like two bathrooms if possible. We would also like a garden, but it would have to have a fence.

<strong>W:   </strong>Right, I’ve got that. Now, do you have any pets…?

<strong>M:   </strong>No, no we don’t.

<strong>W:   </strong>That’s good – some landlords don’t allow pets in the house. Anything else?

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, we’re new to this city, so I don’t know a lot about Northbridge. Is there much to do there?

<strong>W:   </strong>Well, there’s a big shopping mall, and it has a huge cinema complex with about eight theatres, I think.  It’s close to the beach, but the aquarium is not in Northbridge, unfortunately.

<strong>M:   </strong>That’s OK, I don’t think we’d go to the aquarium that often.  What about sports facilities - say, a golf course…?

<strong>W:   </strong>There’s Lincoln Park, that’s nice, but no golf course, I’m afraid.  There’s the Northbridge Tennis Centre, and the public swimming pool is in Meadowvale.

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, it sounds like a very nice area.

<strong>W:   </strong>Great.  I think the best thing is for me to get your details, and then let’s make a time for you to come in,

and we can speak in more detail, and possibly we can show you one or two of the houses that we have.

<strong>M:   </strong>Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

<em>Before you continue, you have some time to look at questions 6 – 10.     * pause *</em>

<em>Now, listen carefully, and answer questions 6 – 10.  </em>

<em> </em>

<strong>W:   </strong>Now, first of all, can you tell me your name?

<strong>M:   </strong>My name is Doug Norcross, that’s N – O – R – C – R – O – double S.

<strong>W:   </strong>Ok, Doug… Norcross…, got it.  And your address at the moment?

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, we’re just in temporary accommodation, we’re staying at 455 Second Avenue.  In Garden Town.

<strong>W:   </strong>That’s a nice area.

<strong>M:  </strong> Yes, yes it is.  But, we need something more permanent.  Do you want my phone number?

<strong>W:   </strong>Yes, I was just about to ask you.  Can I have your mobile phone number?

<strong>M:   </strong>Ok, my mobile is 0 – 4 – 6… 3 – 1 – 1… 2 – 1 – 7 – 8.

<strong>W:   </strong>That was 0 4 6 3 1 2 1 7 8…?

<strong>M:   </strong>No, 0 4 6… 3 – double 1…

<strong>W:  </strong> Ok, 0 4 6 3 1 1 2 1 7 8.  Got it.

<strong>M:   </strong>Good.  Now, when can I come in?  I can come in to tomorrow or Tuesday, if that’s convenient.  We’d really like to get something soon.

<strong>W:   </strong>Tuesday is good.  How about 10 a.m.?

<strong>M:   </strong>Sure. Oh - can we make it at 11?  I have another appointment first thing in the morning, and I wouldn’t want to be late to see you.

<strong>W:   </strong>No problem, 11 o’clock it is, then.  Now, what kind of price range are you looking for?  In Northbridge, properties can go as high as 600 pounds a week.

<strong>M:   </strong>Well, we’d be looking at something a little less than that. The most we want to pay is 500 pounds a week range, but we could go as high as <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q10: 550]</strong> pounds if we had to.

<strong>W:   </strong>Ok… I’ve booked you in to see Charlotte Gardner – she’s our rental property expert, so we’ll see you on Tuesday…   (fade) ….</div>
