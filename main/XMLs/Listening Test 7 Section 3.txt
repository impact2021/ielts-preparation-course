It’s about product placement, you know, how stores might be designed to encourage people to spend more – interesting too!</td>

<td valign="top" width="75%">There was quite a bit available in the university library actually, <span class="answers">but I also found most of my research journals through (Q23) the online library</span>. It’s a brilliant source of information.</td>

<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Ah yes, I remember that from our lectures... it’s passive, aggressive, assertive... oh and what’s the other one. I can’t think now of the 4th one...</td>

<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, passive-aggressive like the name suggests is a kind of a mix of the two behaviours passive and then aggressive.</td>

<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">How does that work then?</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, do you remember that we learned that probably of all the behaviours the most productive way to be is <span class="answers">assertive – this means that you don’t let people just do what they want to if it has a negative effect, but that you’re able to put across your point of view effectively, (Q24) calmly and consider other people too.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Yes that’s right.... and if I remember correctly we talked about how <span class="answers">sometimes people confuse aggression with (Q25) assertiveness.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Yeah, so while <span class="answers">an aggressive person might not just let other people do what they like, they might talk angrily, be too bossy and be (Q26) inconsiderate of other people’s feelings.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Right, so how does that translate into passive aggressive behaviour then? A passive person is quite the opposite of that aren’t they? I mean, they wouldn’t react or get angry or maybe say anything at all about a situation they are not happy with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">That’s true, well <span class="answers">a passive-aggressive personality might not say anything directly to others and would want to avoid (Q27) confrontation probably</span>, but behind the scenes or indirectly they might say angry things or act aggressively. Talking behind someone’s back is an example of a passive aggressive trait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Right and so you are looking at all of this in the context of customer service? I have to say if a customer acted aggressively towards me I would find it hard not to be the same with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Yeah, but the outcome wouldn’t be very positive! There’s a lot of skills that customer service representatives can use if someone is behaving angrily. A really good one I was reading about was to keep using the person’s name – you know, calmly and politely, the theory being that <span class="answers">(Q28/29/30) it is more difficult for a person to treat another person rudely if the conversation is more personalised.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Psychology is interesting isn’t it? I remember our lecturer saying that often <span class="answers">(Q28/29/30) if a customer feels they are being listened to and respected that they are more likely to feel that they have had a good experience with a company</span> – even if they didn’t actually get the product that they wanted. Being given something by someone who has poor customer service skills can be more irritating than being told politely that you’ll have to come back the next day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 2:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%"><span class="answers">(Q28/29/30) Giving clients choices is a useful approach too.</span> You know if you have a complaint about a faulty product and there are none in stock you might ask if they would like a refund or would prefer to wait for a replacement. Giving people choices gives them a feeling of worth and control and reduces the likelihood of them becoming irritable with the wait for the replacement.</td>

<td valign="top" width="25%">Student 1:</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">True, very true. Well I’m going to the library to work on my assignment this afternoon.... why don’t you come with me?</td>
