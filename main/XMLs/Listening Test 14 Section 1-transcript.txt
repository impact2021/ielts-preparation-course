TRAVEL AGENT: Hello. Welcome to the Flight Depot. How can I help you?

CUSTOMER: Well, I’m looking for a reasonably priced holiday. I went to South Africa for a month last year and I’d like to see North America this time – maybe Canada, but I’m also interested in Europe if the prices to Canada are too expensive. I’m on quite a tight budget you see.

TRAVEL AGENT: Well I can certainly get some prices for Canada for you. Vancouver is lovely this time of year, and we have some special offers on at the moment. There are also some special deals for Europe.

CUSTOMER: Okay, well, I have some relatives over in Vancouver so that would be good. I can always travel around Europe next year.

TRAVEL AGENT: Right, let’s have a look at some prices then. When would you like to go?

CUSTOMER:Some time at the end of the end of next month if possible, but I’m quite flexible anytime between the 24th to the 31st. I’d like to go for three weeks.

TRAVEL AGENT: Well there’s lots of availability for those dates. Now, if you’re concerned about the cost, it’s cheaper if you don’t mind not flying direct.

CUSTOMER:Sorry? What do you mean?

TRAVEL AGENT: Well, if you don’t mind changing planes then it’s cheaper.

CUSTOMER:Oh, well, I don’t mind changing planes.

TRAVEL AGENT: In that case, the cheapest flight I have leaves on the 25th and changes in New York. It’s only a short stop – you’ll be in the airport for two and a half hours. How does that sound?

CUSTOMER:Sounds good, but what’s the price?

TRAVEL AGENT: That’s £412 for a return flight, but that doesn’t include airport tax. Would you like to arrange any accommodation?

CUSTOMER:No, I have a cousin I can stay with. All I need is the flight, so I think I’ll take that one.

TRAVEL AGENT: Right, I’ll just check availability for your return. Three weeks did you say?

CUSTOMER:Yes, that’s right.

TRAVEL AGENT: Okay...well there are seats available on the 14th or the 15th. Which one would you prefer?

CUSTOMER:The fifteenth sounds good. Yes, from the 25th to the 15th sounds fine.

TRAVEL AGENT: I’ll reserve that for you then. Can you tell me your name please?

CUSTOMER:Sandra Jackson.

TRAVEL AGENT: Is that J-A-C-K-S-O-N?

CUSTOMER:That’s right.

TRAVEL AGENT: And can I take an address and contact number?

CUSTOMER:Yes, it’s 10, Allen Road, Oldham. Do you want a home number or my mobile?

TRAVEL AGENT: Either’s fine.

CUSTOMER:Well, my home number is 0151 433 398

TRAVEL AGENT: Great. Now, one more thing. Do you have any <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q7: travel insurance]</strong>? We recommend all our clients take some kind of cover, even though most people don’t end up needing it. Most people have it just for peace of mind.

CUSTOMER:Well, what times of cover do you have?

TRAVEL AGENT: Our most comprehensive cover is the Gold Star, which will cost £21 for the period you are away. It’s a good policy because it covers almost all eventualities, even extreme sports such as snow boarding and skydiving.

CUSTOMER:Well, I don’t plan to do anything that dangerous, but £21 sounds fine so I’ll take that too please.

TRAVEL AGENT: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with?

CUSTOMER:Well, do you have any information about what to do in Vancouver?

TRAVEL AGENT: Yes, I’m sure there’s something on the computer that can help. Ahh, yes.

CUSTOMER:There’s a Shakespeare play at the theatre, but it’s quite expensive. That starts at 8pm. The city museum is really popular too, if you like that kind of thing. They have a special exhibition of Japanese armour next month. Entrance is free and the museum is open from 9.00 to 4.30 Monday to Saturday. Would you be interested in either of those?

TRAVEL AGENT: Oh, well..errr, maybe. (sounds hesitant)

CUSTOMER:Well, I’m sure you can arrange that when you get there anyway. So, it’s the flight and the Gold Star insurance. That’s… £433 in total.

TRAVEL AGENT: Can I pay by visa?

CUSTOMER: Yes of course. If you start…. (fade out)</div>
