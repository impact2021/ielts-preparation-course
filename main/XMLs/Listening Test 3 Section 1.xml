<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Hello. Welcome to Pacific Harbour Driving school. How can I help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">Good afternoon. I have a driving test booked for next month, and I want to take some driving lessons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">We can help you there. Have you taken any driving lessons before, or is this your first time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">I did do a short introduction to driving course at high school, and I learned to drive with my father before that.  But I want to get my license, so I need to have some lessons from your school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Of course – that’s no problem.  How long ago did you do the driving course?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">That was last year – no, sorry, that was two years ago. I have a certificate for that course here with me now. Do you need to see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">No, that’s OK – I’ll just make a note about it here though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">OK, great. When do you think I will be able to start the driving lessons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Well, we have a range of different lessons and times, so let me show you the schedule.  You can do a full-time course – that takes five days, from Monday to Friday, and the lessons are for three hours each day. Or you can do three weekends - well, Saturdays actually - five hours each Saturday day, from 9 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">Can you tell me a little more about the five-day course? How much does it cost and what will I learn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Ok, with the five-day course, that’s 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from Monday to Friday. You drive in the city for four days, and will learn about parking, driving in traffic and all the essentials… and then there is one day for learning all the road rules and regulations.  You do the theory on the second day, so that you understand everything while you’re learning to drive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">That sounds like a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Well, it’s not really that hard, it’s over five days so the instructor really takes his time, and you can go at your own speed.  We will also give you a copy of the book you will need to study from with all the rules about driving so you can do some study in your own time. The book’s called <em>Road Rules</em> and is included in the price of the course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">Ok, sounds good.  What about the weekend course?  Is it much different?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">You will cover the same information, it’s just that you do it at different times.  As I said, it’s 9 a.m. to two p.m., and you have an introductory session here at our driving school to get the basics of handling a car, then a couple of hours for theory and the road rules. Over the next 2 Saturdays, you will be driving in traffic, parallel parking and learning proper behaviour on busy city streets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">I think having more time to study between lessons might be good for me, so the weekend course will be better. Yes, I think I’ll sign up for the weekend course.  How much is that?  And when does the next course start?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Well, the weekend course is £295, and the weekday course is £275.  There’s a slight difference in cost because the weekend class is on a Saturday, not our regular hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Man:</td>
<td width="75%">Alright, well, I think I’ll sign up for the weekend course.  Can I start this weekend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Receptionist:</td>
<td width="75%">Let me see if we have any instructors available….  Yes, we do.  John Thompson is available.]]></wp:meta_value>
