<strong>Section 1</strong>

<strong>M:  </strong>Man      <strong>W:  </strong>Woman

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Good afternoon, and welcome to
AngloAir.  Where are you flying to today?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Hi.  I’m
flying to Paris today. After that, I’m going to Munich, but by train, and then
flying back to London.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Sounds interesting.  It’s Mr…?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Wickens, David Wickens.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Ok, well, let’s get you checked in, then,
Mr. Wickens, for Paris.  Do you have your
ticket and passport?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Yes, somewhere here… yes, here they
are.  Ticket… and passport.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Ok, let’s see, economy class, leaving from
City Airport, London, to Paris, leaving 1:30, arriving 3 pm local time, with
the one hour time difference.  Do you
have a seat preference?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Well, it’s a short flight, but I do prefer a
window seat, if one’s available.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Yes, I think there are a couple left, give
me a second here…, yes, here we are.   We
have seat 7A or 16A available.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   The front of the plane, please, so, the
first one.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   No problem, Mr. Wickens.  And are you a Frequent-Flyer member. It’s not
noted here on your booking….</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Yes, I’ve been a member for years - I guess
I forgot to give them my number when I made the booking.  It’s 468319.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   468319, correct?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Yes, that’s it.</span>

<span lang="EN-US"> </span>

<i><span lang="EN-US">You now have some time to read questions 6 to
10. </span></i>

<i><span lang="EN-US">Now listen carefully and answer questions 6
-10.</span></i>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Now, I see your passport is about to expire.
You only have 7 months left.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:
Yes – I’ve already applied for a new one. Is it OK to fly with today?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:
Sure – you need to have at least 6 months remaining to fly. Right, then.  Now, how many bags do you have to check in?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Well, I will check in just this suitcase,
but I have a carry-on briefcase, plus my laptop, but I’ll keep them both with
me.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Right, no problem, just put your bag
here.  How about your carry-on bags?  The weight limit for those is 7 kilograms, in
total.  And for your suitcase, it’s 20
kilograms on these smaller flights.
Let’s weigh your carry-on bags.
Hmm… a total of just under 30 kilograms.
But we’ll just let everything through today, Mr. Wickens.  The flight’s not full, so should be alright.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Ok, thank you for that.  What’s the boarding time for this flight?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:  Well, it’s a 1:30 departure, and it’s noon
now, and you have to be at the Gate 20 minutes before departure for boarding,
so just after 1, 1:10 to be exact.  Try
to be there earlier, though, if you can.
Often, the flight can leave a little earlier, that is, if everyone’s on
board.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:  Ok, no problem.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:  Now, I think that’s just about
everything.  I hope you have a good
flight, and, just for the future, a couple of suggestions.  Do you usually get a ticket, or have you used
our E-Ticket service?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:  Yes, of course, I normally get an E-Ticket,
but, my secretary was away, so I just bought an ordinary ticket.  </span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:  Oh, ok.
And, of course, on our Atlantic flights, do you ever use our
E-Check-in?  You can check in
electronically.  </span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Yes, I always do that, but you don’t have
that service here for the Paris flight.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Correct, that’s coming soon.  And, finally, do you normally stay at the
same hotel here in London?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Yes, usually, I do.  Why?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">W:   Well, I suggest that you get one of our
brochures about all of our services, including accommodation, check-in
facilities, range of flight services and transportation options.  If you just ask at our Service Counter - it’s
just past the Check-In facilities - I think you’ll be interested in some of the
things we offer.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">M:   Ok.
That sounds great, I appreciate your advice.  And thanks for your help… </span>
