Anne: Hello I wonder if you could help me. I am interested in enrolling on your M.B.A programme. Could you give me some information please?

Admissions officer: Yes of course. I’ll take a few details first of all and I’ll give you a copy of our prospectus.

Anne: Oh that’s okay. I already have one here. I’ve been researching the MBA courses in the local area, so I already have lots of course information!

Admissions officer: That’s great. Okay so first of all, can you tell me your name please?

Anne: Yes of course. It’s Anne Hawberry.

Admissions officer: Hawberry. Is that H-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y?

Anne: Yes that’s right.

Admissions officer: Okay and how old are you Ms Hawberry?

Anne: I’m 24. My date of birth is 22 May 1981.

Admissions officer: That’s great. And were you born in the UK?

Anne: Yes I was.

Admissions officer: Alright, can you give me some contact details please?

Anne: Sure. My address is 26 Simon Place in Brighton and my telephone number is 01903 534 345.

Admissions officer: Sorry, can you tell me your contact number once again?

Anne: Yes, it’s 01903, 534 345.

Admissions officer: Okay. Great. And do you have a mobile phone number?

Anne: No, I don’t – is it important?

Admissions officer: No that’s OK, I’ll just write it on your form –no…. mobile …..phone. Now just a few additional questions. Are you working or studying anywhere else at the moment?

Anne: Yes. I am working for Lloyd Enterprises in the city as a <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q6: secretary]</strong> and I am also studying a computer course part time in the evenings.

Admissions officer: Great. So can you give me some details about your educational back ground? We need to make sure that your qualifications match the entry requirements.

Anne: Yes I completed a degree in <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q7: Business degree]</strong> a year ago and I graduated with a 2:1. I’ve been working since my graduation, but the job market is very competitive these days, so I’d like to do some post-graduate study now.

Admissions officer: Okay that sounds fine. Your degree is relevant and it is good that you have some work experience too. I do need to warn you though that our MBA programme is <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q8: extremely popular]</strong> and gets full quickly, so would you be interested in applying for any alternative courses if you application is not successful this time?

Anne: Well….. My first choice would of course be the MBA, but yes, I’ve had a good look through your prospectus and I would also be interested in the MA in <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q9: International Marketing]</strong>.

Admissions officer: That’s great, it’s always a good idea to keep your options open just in case.

Admissions officer: Well, just a few more questions. Can you tell me how you plan to fund your tuition throughout the course?

Anne: Yes, personal means. I have savings and my parents have also promised to contribute. I don’t think I’ll need any bank loans at this stage.

Admissions officer: Well finally, can you tell me how you learned about or courses here?

Anne: Actually my cousin studied on the MBA course two years ago and she recommended it to me.

Admissions officer: Okay, well thank you for coming in today. I will pass your details on to our <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q10: admissions department]</strong>. They will contact you this week with a formal application form and they usually invite MBA candidates for interview.

Anne: Okay, well thanks for you time.

Admissions officer: No problem. Good luck with your application.</div>
