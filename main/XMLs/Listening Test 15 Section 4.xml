<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[<div class="transcript"><strong>Section 4</strong>

Over the past 50 years, there have been some radical changes in the medicine as it is known in the West. This is largely the result of vast improvements in technology, but also in the rising importance of ‘alternative’ treatments. I have with me today Matthew East, a registered osteopath and a supporter of alternative techniques in healthcare. Matthew, can you tell us more about osteopathy?

Well, perhaps the first thing I should say is that the term ‘alternative’ is actually a little misleading, as I am referring to approaches and attitudes to health that were in common use long before western medicine was established. I prefer the term ‘<strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q4: natural]</strong>’. Anyway, I’ll begin by telling you a little about osteopathy. Basically, osteopathy is the manipulation of <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q32: muscles]</strong> in order to alleviate stresses and tensions that lead to pain. Now unlike western medicine, osteopathy considers <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q33: the whole body]</strong>, not just the affected area, and this is a very important principle of natural remedies. The whole body must be considered before a course of treatment can be decided upon. You see, the aim of therapies like osteopathy is not only to repair the body, but also to get the body treating itself, and this does not come from treating the symptoms. To give an example, I recently treated a two-month-old baby who was screaming all day and was even worse at night. The couple had taken the baby to their doctor, but the only advice they were given was that the baby ‘would grow out of it’. However, the real problem stemmed from <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q34: a difficult birth]</strong> which had put pressure on their baby’s neck. After ten minutes of gentle manipulation the pressure was released and within 20 minutes, the baby was quiet and calm for the first time. This was achieved without drugs or operations. Avoiding such <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q35: invasive]</strong> methods of treatment highlights another of the differences between western medicine and a more natural approach. You see, western medicine often uses surgery in order to find a solution to problems that could have been addressed with simple remedies. A medical approach that looks closely at how essential an operation is before it is performed would offer patients a considerably less stressful method of treatment, not to mention the financial savings. Natural remedies actually amount to less than <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q36: ten percent]</strong> of the cost of a western course of treatment.

I’d like to mention the subject of surgery again a little later, but I would like to say at this point that there are those that claim that the benefits of osteopathy and herbal therapies are largely psychological, that they have not undergone the clinical trials that pharmaceuticals have. To answer that, you only need to look at the example I gave earlier, of the baby that stopped crying less than an hour after treatment but was obviously far too young to react because of purely psychological factors. Another example can be seen in the successful use of acupuncture in the treatment of animals. In response to criticism regarding clinical trials, it is worth noting that the power of pharmaceutical companies is such that although some drugs fail the standards required of them, they are sometimes still prescribed by doctors.

Moving on to another point, it should be stressed that natural remedies, in addition to having no side effects, can also be applied to any patient. Now I’m not suggesting that the same treatments are used indiscriminately. I’m referring to the fact that treatment is the same with natural therapies regardless of age, but very specific to the person. By this I mean that not only the general health of the patient needs to be considered, but also their habits, diet and lifestyle in order to build a complete picture.

However, I am not suggesting that we should reject western medicine entirely. In fact, there have been occasions when I have referred patients to their doctor as I felt that in those cases it was the most suitable course of action. There are many situations in which it is by far the best option. Take <strong style="background-color: yellow;">[Q40: emergency surgery]</strong>, for example. Obviously more natural remedies do not provide the speed required in such cases. The best solution would therefore be an open-minded combination of the two forms.

Well, thank you very much Matthew. That was a very interesting insight into alternative, sorry natural, treatments. Next week we’ll be inviting Dr Moore onto the programme to argue his case as a doctor. Until next week, then, goodbye.</div>]]></wp:meta_value>
