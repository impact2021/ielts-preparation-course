Anne: Hello I wonder if you could help me. I am interested in enrolling on your M.B.A programme. Could you give me some information please?

Admissions officer: Yes of course. I’ll take a few details first of all and I’ll give you a copy of our prospectus.

Anne: Oh that’s okay. I already have one here. I’ve been researching the MBA courses in the local area, so I already have lots of course information!

Admissions officer: That’s great. Okay so first of all, can you tell me your name please?

[Q1]Anne: Yes of course. It’s Anne Hawberry.

Admissions officer: Hawberry. Is that H-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y?

Anne: Yes that’s right.

Admissions officer: Okay and how old are you Ms Hawberry?

[Q2]Anne: I’m 24. My date of birth is 22 May 1981.

Admissions officer: That’s great. And were you born in the UK?

Anne: Yes I was.

Admissions officer: Alright, can you give me some contact details please?

[Q3]Anne: Sure. My address is 26 Simon Place in Brighton and my telephone number is 01903 534 345.

Admissions officer: Sorry, can you tell me your contact number once again?

[Q4]Anne: Yes, it’s 01903, 534 345.

Admissions officer: Okay. Great. And do you have a mobile phone number?

[Q5]Anne: No, I don’t – is it important?

Admissions officer: No that’s OK, I’ll just write it on your form –no…. mobile …..phone. Now just a few additional questions. Are you working or studying anywhere else at the moment?

[Q6]Anne: Yes. I am working for Lloyd Enterprises in the city as a secretary and I am also studying a computer course part time in the evenings.

Admissions officer: Great. So can you give me some details about your educational back ground? We need to make sure that your qualifications match the entry requirements.

[Q7]Anne: Yes I completed a degree in Business degree a year ago and I graduated with a 2:1. I’ve been working since my graduation, but the job market is very competitive these days, so I’d like to do some post-graduate study now.

[Q8]Admissions officer: Okay that sounds fine. Your degree is relevant and it is good that you have some work experience too. I do need to warn you though that our MBA programme is extremely popular and gets full quickly, so would you be interested in applying for any alternative courses if you application is not successful this time?

[Q9]Anne: Well….. My first choice would of course be the MBA, but yes, I’ve had a good look through your prospectus and I would also be interested in the MA in International Marketing.

Admissions officer: That’s great, it’s always a good idea to keep your options open just in case.

Admissions officer: Well, just a few more questions. Can you tell me how you plan to fund your tuition throughout the course?

Anne: Yes, personal means. I have savings and my parents have also promised to contribute. I don’t think I’ll need any bank loans at this stage.

Admissions officer: Well finally, can you tell me how you learned about or courses here?

Anne: Actually my cousin studied on the MBA course two years ago and she recommended it to me.

[Q10]Admissions officer: Okay, well thank you for coming in today. I will pass your details on to our admissions department. They will contact you this week with a formal application form and they usually invite MBA candidates for interview.

Anne: Okay, well thanks for you time.

Admissions officer: No problem. Good luck with your application.]]></wp:meta_value>
