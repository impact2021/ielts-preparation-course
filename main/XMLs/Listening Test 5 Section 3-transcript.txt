<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, I would first of all like to congratulate everyone on going out and completing your interviews for our survey last week. I know it must have been difficult practicing your English in the real world and interviewing native speakers of English, who you have never met before, must have been a challenge. I hope you enjoyed the exercise and found some interesting information on lifestyles here in this country. I’d now like the leaders for each of the groups to give me some feedback. First, let’s hear from you John.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well…as English is not our first language I expected it would be quite difficult talking to people we had never met before. <u> I was (Q21) quite nervous about having to go out and interview strangers; but once we started I enjoyed it and we met some very friendly and interesting people.</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And how about your group Connie? What did you find to be most challenging about the exercise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, I think it was when we eventually went over to people to ask if they would take part in the survey, it was fine once we had started the conversation, but <u>approaching people was quite nerve-wrecking as we could never be sure that they would be friendly and happy to help, or whether they would be (Q22) rude to us.</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And so were many people rude to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">No they weren’t. Some people would not answer questions because they were on their lunch break from work and were in a hurry, everybody else was happy to help – and even the people who didn’t complete the survey because they didn’t have time were still friendly and polite. <u>We found it particularly useful as we (Q23) recorded the interviews on audio tape, so we could listen again when we had finished. We realised afterwards that we had misunderstood quite few things people were saying at the time.</u> <u>it was interesting to find out about the different (Q24) culture </u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">So John, how did your group decide who to interview?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, our questions were asking about how frequently people took exercise and what sorts of hobbies and interests they pursued in their spare time. <u>We decided that we should try to interview a variation of different age groups and an (Q25) equal number of men and women. </u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And how did you split them by age group?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Two members of the team were told to interview teenagers – people who looked like they were 18 or under. Then two people focused on people who looked to be between 18-35. Two more were stopping people who seemed to be between the 35-50 age group and than I interviewed people who looked to be over 50.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And what was the topic for your survey Connie ?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">We asked our interviewees about attitudes to healthy eating - you know, whether they ate junk food such as burgers and fries or more wholesome food. <u>We also asked them about how often they drank things like (Q26) coffee and alcohol</u>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And how many interviews did your group complete John?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">We interviewed 18 people in total and had an additional 4 who would not stop to answer questions. Our original target was 20 so we did pretty well I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">So Connie, how many people did your group talk to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">We managed to complete all 20 interviews and three people were too busy to stop and help us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well, I think that’s very good, well done to both groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">So, John, what did you group find out about exercise habits and hobbies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Well we found that the males who were under 35 were more likely to be a member of a sports team, such as cricket, soccer or rugby than either the older age groups or women. <u>Women were more involved in (Q27) individual exercise such as yoga, aerobics or going to the gym, rather than being members of an actual team.</u> Sailing was the most popular sport for the over 35s followed by hiking and then golf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Okay, so that covers sports, what about other ways of relaxing and enjoying leisure time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">John</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">As you’d expect, the under 18s were the more frequent users of the internet, but the most popular pastime in that category was socializing with friends. <u>There were a wide variety of hobbies and interests mentioned in the other age groups including (Q28) reading, attending sports games as a spectator, playing chess and craftwork.</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">That’s interesting. And Connie, what did your group discover about eating and drinking habits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%"><u>It seemed that the older groups (those over 35) were more concerned about healthy eating. They ate (Q29) junk food less often than the 18-35s</u>, on average once every two weeks as opposed to once or twice a week. All age categories said that they believed they ate enough fruit, interestingly, more 18-35s than people in older categories said they thought that they didn’t eat vegetables often enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">And what about drinking habits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Connie</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Drinking coffee was popular for all age categories and <u>there was a trend towards preferring (Q30) real coffee as opposed to instant varieties. </u>The 18-35s said that they would regularly buy coffee to take away from well known outlets. Most people said that they drank only safe amounts of alcohol and the most popular alcoholic drinks were wine and beer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="25%">Teacher</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">That’s great, once again well done. We will have our next class in the computer lab and we’ll look at ways of analysing information from market research surveys.</td>
