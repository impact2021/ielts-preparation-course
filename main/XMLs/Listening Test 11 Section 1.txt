<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Yes, of course. The long weekend specials run from Thursday to Sunday or from Friday to Monday. You need to book for a minimum of three nights. For the weekly packages you receive a 5% discount, free parking at any London airport if you choose to fly here and pick up from our local airport.</td>

<td valign="top" width="20%">customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Oh right. I don’t think we’ll fly - we’re planning to stay somewhere on the way for a night or two to break up the journey as we’re planning on coming by car. What prices do the rooms work out to be for the three night package?</td>

<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">It depends if you would like to book for the room only, room with breakfast, room with breakfast and dinner, or for the room with breakfast each day and dinner first night only – there are four options you see. And of course it also depends on how many people you would you be booking for.</td>

<td valign="top" width="20%">customer</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Just two of us. We’d like to arrive on Thursday 17th and check out on Sunday 20th please. And we’d be interested in booking the room, with breakfast each morning and... erm... probably just dinner at the hotel for the first night only.</td>

<td valign="top" width="20%">hotel receptionist</td>
<td valign="top" width="80%">Okay, just let me check that availability... Yes, we do have some double rooms left for those dates. So that’s Thursday 17th, leaving Sunday 20th Now a room for two with breakfast each day and dinner the first evening works out at a total of £380. That’s £110 per night including breakfast and a specially discounted three course dinner for two for £50 in our al a carte restaurant.</td>
