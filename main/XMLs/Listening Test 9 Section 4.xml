</strong>

<strong>Man:  </strong>Good morning, students.  Today, we’re going to continue our examination of indigenous cultures, looking at some of the common threads that bind them together, interestingly, often across continents…, and today, we’ll be looking at a specific form of water transport, namely, dugouts, canoes, or sometimes what are known as logboats, that is, a boat constructed mainly from a single log.  It’s quite amazing, actually, as we’ll see, the similarities that exist across the cultures, and, indeed, through the centuries.

It is interesting to note that archaeological evidence of manmade boats dates back to more than10,000 years ago, and yet, in parts of Thailand and Myanmar, some local tribes still construct traditional dugout canoes and use them today for transport, commercial operations, such as transporting merchandise, and fishing and hunting.

So, what is a dugout canoe?  Well, as described earlier, a dugout canoe, or logboat, is exactly as its name implies, a canoe dug out from a carefully selected log to suit the purposes of its intent.  The construction of the dugout is remarkably similar when examining the different cultures.  The first criterion is to choose a tree, soon to become a log of the appropriate size and dimensions.  Depending on the continent and environment, different types of trees, or wood, were selected through the years and the development of the dugout, and the different strengths and durabilities were known to the locals, often according to the density of the wood.  Once the correct length was decided, the log was then shaped with pointed ends to help with propulsion through the water, and to reduce friction at the rear, and the log was stripped of branches and bark.  Going back 8000 years, metal tools were not used, so, one of the methods used to hollow out the log, after the top third of the length was removed, was using a series of small fires carefully monitored by the builders, who then removed the burnt wood and ash using primitive tools.  It was important during the construction to ensure that enough wood was taken from the log to ensure that the canoe would be light enough in weight and buoyancy, but would still be robust and strong enough to hold the sailors, and any cargo they might be carrying.  After the log, now soon to be a sea-going canoe, was hollowed out, the insides of the log were smoothed using the tools of the day, such as what is known as an adze, a small ax-like implement used to smooth and level rough surfaces.  As well, tree sap was used to smooth, patch over and to help adhere extra parts, such as rudimentary seats and to help with outrigger and sail design.  The earlier dugouts followed the shape of the tree, or log, keeping a round bottom, but as primitive technology advanced, innovations were seized on and one example is that it was discovered that the log could be heated, and steamed, and thus shaped to some degree, with a wider beam and flatter bottom, thus allowing more sailors to be carried.

One interesting feature that has been noted that a number of indigenous cultures have developed was the use of an outrigger, that is, a log that is fixed parallel to the main hull by long, often curved poles, and in some cases, two outriggers were affixed, one on each side, thus increasing stability, and allowing for deep-sea voyages of some distances, sometimes reaching up to 500 kilometres.

&nbsp;

Now, let’s take a look at some particular dugouts specific to some cultures.  Perhaps the oldest known dugout is known as the Pesse Canoe, which was discovered in the Netherlands, and has been carbon-dated to more than 8000 years BC.  Other European dugouts have been uncovered in Germany dating back more than 7000 years and one was 12 metres in length, which, makes it the longest old European dugout.  A dugout located in Ireland in 1902 was measured at over 15 metres and dated back some 4000 years, and was one of the first to have a series of holes in a pattern, which indicated that it may have been one of the first to incorporate an outrigger design.

In Africa, in particular, Nigeria, evidence shows that the oldest known vessel is an 8000-year-old dugout known as the Dufuna Canoe, which is also recognized as the third-oldest in the world.  African dugouts were used for transport across the deep lakes and up and down rivers and across swamps.  Teak, a native hardwood, was the most common wood used for the construction of dugouts, and because much of Africa was colonized by the French, the word ‘pirogue’ is the local term for dugout canoe.

In North America, most of the ocean-going dugout canoe activity was centered in the Pacific North-West, that is, British Columbia in Canada, on the west coast, and Washington state in the United States.  The famous birch-bark canoe of the North American Indian was only for inland lake and river travel, but the Pacific North-West dugouts were hollowed out of huge cedar and fir logs, often decorated with carvings and indigenous designs, perhaps originating from their famous totem pole construction.  The Indian tribes constructed large ocean-going canoes, sometimes up to 20 metres in length, carrying up to 60 or 70 paddlers, and travelling long distances.  In 1978, an anthropology crew in Canada made the nearly seven thousand five hundred kilometer crossing from Canada to Hawaii in a constructed dugout canoe to prove that earlier ocean-going tribes were capable of such a crossing.

In New Zealand and the South Pacific Islands, the indigenous peoples were well-known for the construction of their deep-sea crafts, known in New Zealand as ‘waka’ with their distinctive outriggers for stability and increased steering.  Like the North American craft, these canoes were capable of carrying up to 80 sailors, or warriors, if the need dictated, and again there is anthropological evidence that possibly the ocean-crossing vessels came from islands in the northern parts of the Pacific, settling in the South Pacific islands and New Zealand.  The New Zealand waka was further developed by extending the basic canoe with the addition of other parts, lashed and tied together with a rope fashioned from the native flax plant.  As well, dugout canoes from Hawaii and the South Pacific were noted for their additional features, the main one being a sail which aided in propulsion.

The basic dugout canoe has had a wide-ranging impact on indigenous culture.  As mentioned earlier, the canoe served as a primary means of transport, both domestically, and in some cultures, crossing oceans and seas to explore, settle or even combat with different groups.  As well, basic forms of sustenance such as hunting and fishing were facilitated with the dugout canoe, and, as trading emerged, commerce was given a boost as the larger dugouts were able to move merchandise and goods great distances and… (fade)]]></wp:meta_value>
