# ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT CREATE NEW GENERATORS ⚠️

## IMPORTANT RULE

**NEVER create new XML generators for listening tests.**

## Why This Rule Exists

This repository was simplified on December 30, 2025, after **weeks of confusion** caused by having 12 different generators with no clear guidance on which to use.

**The Problem:**
- Test 6 Section 1 alone was generated by 3 different scripts over 2 days
- Each generator had different capabilities and feedback quality
- Nobody knew which generator to use
- Massive time waste and frustration

**The Solution:**
- **DELETED:** 11 obsolete generators
- **KEPT:** ONE master generator

## The ONE Generator

**File:** `generate_listening_xml_master.py`

**What it does:**
- ✅ ALL listening test question types
- ✅ FULL feedback auto-generated
- ✅ Works with ALL listening tests (1-15+)
- ✅ Batch processing support

**What it does NOT do:**
- ❌ Reading tests
- ❌ Writing tests
- ❌ Speaking tests
- ❌ Other exercise types

## Rules for Future Development

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. Use `generate_listening_xml_master.py` for all listening test XML generation
2. Enhance/improve the existing master generator if needed
3. Fix bugs in the master generator if found

### ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
1. Create new generators for listening tests
2. Create "specialized" generators for specific test ranges
3. Create "temporary" generators for one-off tasks
4. Duplicate the master generator with modifications

## If You Need Changes

**DON'T create a new generator.**

**DO modify the existing one:**
```bash
# Edit the master generator
vim main/XMLs/generate_listening_xml_master.py

# Test your changes
python3 generate_listening_xml_master.py --test 6

# Commit the improvement
git add main/XMLs/generate_listening_xml_master.py
git commit -m "Improve master generator: [description]"
```

## If You Need Different Test Types

Reading tests, writing tests, or other exercises are **different content types** that need their own solutions. They cannot use the listening test generator because:

- Different data structures
- Different question types
- Different validation rules
- Different output formats

Create separate, clearly-named generators for those if needed (e.g., `generate_reading_xml_master.py`), but **NEVER** create additional listening test generators.

## Remember

**One generator for listening tests. Period.**

This rule exists to prevent repeating a mistake that cost weeks of time. Don't break it.
