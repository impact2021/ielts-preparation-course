        "transcript": "<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Excuse me. I'm not sure if I'm in the right place, but I'm trying to find out more about the Hospitality Degree courses?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Yes, you're in the right place. My name is Kathryn, I can hopefully answer any questions you might have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Nice to meet you. My name is Barry. Barry McDonald.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> So Barry, have you seen our new hospitality prospectus yet? It just came out last week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Yes, I've already had a look at it. I thought it was really useful actually, but I need more information on the different ways you can study the course, you know, full-time, part-time, by distance etc. I didn't understand the different options completely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Okay, well we offer the different choices to try to match the needs of different people's situations. There are advantages and disadvantages to each mode of study. It really depends on your own circumstances. Are you working at the moment?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Yes, I've been working in corporate hospitality at a local hotel for the last <span id=\"transcript-q21\" data-question=\"21\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q21</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">three years</span>; we arrange functions and conferences for business clients. Before that, I worked on reception at a leisure centre for one year, so I have about four years' work experience relevant to the industry. I'm hoping to study a degree so I have a better chance of being promoted to Hospitality Manager in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Okay, that's good. And are you planning to leave your current job to study your course or are you thinking of taking a shorter period of time off or study as you work?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I would like to know what is possible really. I don't want to quit my job as I enjoy it and studying full-time would not be possible financially for me. My current employers are quite supportive of me studying for a higher qualification. They'll pay something towards my costs and I can arrange some time off if necessary, but obviously the less it interferes with my work commitments the better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> So the full time course is not really suitable for you then?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> No, not really. My employer will pay for the <span id=\"transcript-q22\" data-question=\"22\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q22</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">course fees and a proportion of my living costs</span>, but of course only if I work for them full-time as well. They have agreed to give me extra unpaid leave when I need it at certain times of year – you know to revise for examinations and things like that. I wouldn't be able to study the course if I had to pay for the whole thing myself and support myself while I was studying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Okay, well there are two other options for you to think about. You could do the part-time course which involves evening classes, that takes <span id=\"transcript-q23\" data-question=\"23\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q23</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">5 years</span> instead of the usual three years full-time. Or you could study for the degree on-line. There is more flexibility with how long it takes as you can choose to study different numbers of papers in different semesters to fit your free time. Most people complete the degree in 4 years when they study as a distance student online.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> So how many hours does the part-time course involve?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> You join an evening class and there are lectures three times a week. Part-time students also have to attend a seminar one weekend a month – our on-line students attend those too; for the courses they have enrolled in for that semester.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> And can you tell me more about the kind of coursework I would have to do?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> It depends on which courses you are enrolled in. Generally you have to write 2 assignments for each course you are enrolled in over a semester and some courses (though not all) also have an end of semester examination. For example, the accounting module is all coursework based. For communication courses you need to keep a study diary which counts towards some of your marks and assignments are in essay format but the management modules involve <span id=\"transcript-q24\" data-question=\"24\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q24</span></span><span id=\"transcript-q25\" data-question=\"25\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q25</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">written reports and a final exam</span>. Some of the marketing papers also involve giving presentations and completing reports.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> That sounds like a lot of work, as well as working full-time I mean, do you think it is possible to study the course and work at the same time?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Yes, it is possible. A lot of people do it, but it can be quite tiring and you don't have a great deal of free time!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> So which do you think would be better for me, the part-time evening course or the online course?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> Well, the advantage of the online course is that it doesn't follow a fixed <span id=\"transcript-q26\" data-question=\"26\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q26</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">study plan</span> you can take on more modules in semesters when you have more free time, but fewer at times when you are busy doing other things. If you enrol in the part-time course, you have to follow the fixed programme. Some people prefer the online course because it is more flexible, whereas others prefer the part-time evening classes because they get more regular face to face contact with their lecturer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I think I would be confident enough to study online, after all I have quite a bit of experience in the hospitality field already. How many modules are there in the whole degree?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> There are <span id=\"transcript-q27\" data-question=\"27\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q27</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">24 modules</span> in total; whichever way you study you have to complete all of them. 14 are compulsory and then the other <span id=\"transcript-q28\" data-question=\"28\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q28</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">10 modules</span> are chosen from a variety of options. <span id=\"transcript-q29\" data-question=\"29\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q29</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">Full-time students</span> complete 8 modules each year, but obviously part-time and online students study them over a longer period of time. On average, online students tend to study 6 modules per year, but this varies as students can <span id=\"transcript-q30\" data-question=\"30\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q30</span></span><span class=\"transcript-answer-marker\">decide</span> their own workload.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Well that sounds really good. I need to think a little bit more about whether the part-time evening course or the online course will suit best. Thanks for your help and I'll be in touch again soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn:</strong> You're very welcome and I'm sure you will enjoy the course.</p>"
