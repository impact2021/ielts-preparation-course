      "question": "1. [field 1] pollution we are discharging into our rivers and 2. [field 2] lakes is causing long term damage to 3. [field 3] world's ecosystems. A large proportion of 4. [field 4] damage we inflict is, in reality, avoidable. For example, widespread usage of 5. [field 5] biodegradable washing powder would reduce 6. [field 6] negative effect we have.\n\nHuman activity has also contributed enormously to air pollution, especially from 7. [field 7] vehicles we drive which emit 8. [field 8] fumes harmful to 9. [field 9] environment. Many governments are now introducing legislation to reduce the number of older cars on the road as these cause more problems than newer models. For example, in 10. [field 10] Japan it is rare to see 11. [field 11] car of more than 4 or 5 years old being driven as changes in vehicle registration laws have made it exceptionally expensive to drive anything other than 12. [field 12] relatively new car.",
