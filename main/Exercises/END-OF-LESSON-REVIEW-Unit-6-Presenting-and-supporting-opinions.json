Many students still need to research using both sources as the information they need to complete an assignment may not be available free of charge on the web. Journals, for instance, <span style=\"color: red\">(3) it could be argued</span> are often not found in their full form unless a subscription is paid.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, many people enjoy reading traditional books. Whilst E-books are now available on the internet, <span style=\"color: red\">(4) there are reasons to suggest</span> many enjoy the convenience of being able to read anywhere at any time. To illustrate, libraries allow the general public access to a range of books which they might not be able to afford to buy and that they can take away and enjoy without needing to sit in front of a computer screen.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, if individuals have a home computer, <span style=\"color: red\">(5) there are arguments to be made for stating that</span> it is much more convenient to access information than having to visit a library; indeed some members of society, rural dwellers for example, may find it difficult to get to a library. However, many offer mobile services whereby their books can be accessed from other locations, not just the main library building itself.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, while the internet has provided an alternative way of accessing information, libraries still provide a useful service; it is likely, given the arguments above, that they will continue to play a significant role.</p>"

Obesity can be easily avoided by people making simple changes to their way of life. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>\r\n<p>There is a school of thought that believes it is possible for most individuals to be slim if they live a healthy lifestyle. [WHICH PHRASE(S) FIT HERE?] as will now be explained.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, diets, particularly in Western cultures are often very high in fat. This means that although people may think they are not eating too much, the food they consume is very high in calories. Traditional diets of other cultures are [WHICH PHRASE(S) FIT HERE?] and therefore people can eat a larger quantity of food without putting on weight; the Japanese diet is a good example of this.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, [WHICH PHRASE(S) FIT HERE?]. If we are active we are able to raise our metabolism and use the calories we consume, reducing the likelihood of becoming obese. It may be advisable for people suffering with weight problems to participate in some kind of exercise programme, for example, aerobics or jogging, however some people are not motivated enough to participate in a regular training programme.</p>\r\n<p>Granted, some people find it difficult to maintain a healthy weight because of a physical condition. Some are genetically predisposed to be heavier than others and in addition there are many medical conditions which can slow down metabolism. However, under doctor's supervision even people in such situations should be able successfully to follow a weight loss programme.</p>\r\n<p>To conclude, [WHICH PHRASE(S) FIT HERE?]; however, it is likely that many people may not be willing to make necessary changes and that therefore the problem will continue.</p>"
