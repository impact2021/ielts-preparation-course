      "question": "<p>How do you think technology has affected the way in which we entertain ourselves?</p>\r\n<p>Well, I think it has had an enormous impact on hobbies such as listening to music and to a lesser extent watching movies, especially for the younger generation. I think it must have affected the number of people who buy CDs for example. I think that 1. [field 1] people must buy them now as so much music is available on the internet.</p>\r\n<p>Amongst younger people, there is 2. [field 2] enthusiasm for accumulating a CD collection; most of us today just stream music directly online.</p>\r\n<p>I suppose there is 3. [field 3] more interest in traditional CDs amongst older people though!</p>\r\n<p>Regarding watching movies, although 4. [field 4] of my friends are still interested in going to the cinema, I think more and more of us are starting to watch more online.</p>\r\n<p>I suppose the concept of sitting in front of a computer to watch a movie doesn't appeal to everyone though and I suppose relatively 5. [field 5] people in my parent's age group would do that, they still prefer the comfort of a cinema.</p>\r\n<p>I like going to the cinema to watch a blockbuster movie, especially if it has special effects as they are so much more impressive on the big screen. I am 6. [field 6] interested in going to watch ordinary films though as it is so expensive in comparison to buying a cinema ticket.</p>\r\n",
