Holidays over 4 weeks were in the minority at [field 2] percent. Almost [field 3] quarters of holidays were taken in Europe and less than [field 4] tenth in South America and Asia combined. They were the least visited destinations.\n\nIn 1990, the percentage of holidays less than one week remained steady with just a [field 5] percent decrease. There was a [field 6]percent fall in holidays of one to two weeks, yet holidays longer than this accounted for one [field 7] as opposed to less than a [field 8] in 1950. There was an inverse correlation between the increasing percentage of people who went abroad for over two weeks and the percentage who visited Europe. The percentage of visitors to Asia more than doubled and to South America more than tripled.\n\nOverall, Europe remained the most visited destination even though visitors declined by [field 9] five percent over the period shown.",
