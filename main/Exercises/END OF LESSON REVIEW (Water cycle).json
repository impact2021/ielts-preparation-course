Once the condensation [field 1], in the next step it [field 2] in the rain clouds which then travel over land. After that, the precipitation falls to the ground.<br><br>Next the water which has fallen to the ground can flow in two directions. Water which remains at the surface of the land [field 3] as run off water; this directly rejoins the sea, while other water sinks below the earth's surface where it becomes ground water. This moves under ground to the discharge point and also rejoins the sea. At this stage the process begins again when once more the water evaporates into the atmosphere.<br><br>This ends the description of the water cycle process.",

          "correct": "Correct! 'has been formed' is the present perfect passive form. The present perfect passive (has/have been + past participle) is used here because the condensation must be formed before it can be transported, indicating a completed action with relevance to the next step.",
          "incorrect": "Incorrect. You need the present perfect passive form here (has/have been + past participle). The condensation needs to be fully formed before the next stage can occur.",

          "incorrect": "Incorrect. You need the present simple passive form here (is/are + past participle). The subject 'it' (referring to condensation) is singular, so use 'is'. This describes the regular movement of water vapor in clouds.",
