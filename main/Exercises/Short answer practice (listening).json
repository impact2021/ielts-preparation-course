        "transcript": "<p>Thank you for coming, in this seminar we are going focus on skills and tips for writing a good CV – or resume, as some of you may call it – and also discuss some points to avoid as they may be off-putting to a potential employer selecting applicants for an interview. Remember that the details included in your CV, are the only insight that the recruiter has of you, so your message must be clear and your CV must be designed to inspire that person to want to find out more about you.</p>\n\n<p>I am glad to see so many people attending and I hope that you will find the information I am going to give you today useful in your search for employment. Now all of you are in the final year of your degree and will soon graduate, for many of you it will the first time you will be applying for <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">full-time work</span> positions, though I know a number of you already have part-time jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that for most advertised positions these days, there are a large number of applicants, so your CV needs to convince the reader that you have something special to bring to the position that others do not. For this reason, writing a generic CV and sending it out for all the positions you are applying for is unlikely to result in <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">success</span>. The person in charge of recruitment in each company is going to be looking to interview candidates who match their specific requirements and will be able to operate successfully in the role they are specifically advertising. While it may appear <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">time-consuming</span> having to tailor your information to a particular application, believe me, in the long run it is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>It is common nowadays to include an 'objective' statement, which is usually two or three lines describing yourself, your characteristics and what type of role you are looking for. I am sure that many of you are aware of the common buzz-words often used in CVs such as 'dedicated, self-starter seeking challenging role…'. However, once again, keep this statement <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">specific</span>, if it does not clearly relate to the job in question, it is meaningless as the reader will almost certainly just skim over the information and is unlikely to give it <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">any real attention</span>. Putting in extra effort prior to sending out a handful of applications, will most likely produce more results than a hundred which are not thought through properly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As I am sure you know, it is standard practice when writing a CV to start with personal details, moving on to a section about education then on to work history in chronological order: this means in sequence of dates employed, usually starting with the most recent roles. For new graduates from university, it may be difficult to find ways of impressing employers with a work history as it is likely to be limited or even non-existent. However, don't underestimate the significance of experience that you may have gained in a <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">summer job</span> or <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">voluntary work</span>; if your experience is limited, you could even think about beginning some part-time work now so that you have something relevant to write on your CV.</p>\n\n<p>A big mistake when describing work experience is to simply list duties of the job and not the actual <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">personal achievements</span>. Imagine you are applying for a role in administration and your only work experience so far has been temping positions as a receptionist. 'Resolved a situation involving a dissatisfied client through customer service skills and prompt referral to the appropriate department' should be included rather than simply: 'responsible for handling telephone enquiries'. Do remember though, that if you include such information in your CV that it is likely that the interviewer will ask you about it, should you be successful in getting to the interview stage.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would like to add that it is a good idea to have someone look over your CV before you send it out, you should ask them to check for any <span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">spelling or grammar</span> errors and also give you feedback on the layout and design of the CV and whether they think it is interesting, appealing and has a logical flow. Avoid using too many different font styles which can make the CV uncomfortable to read and I recommend that you try to keep the length to <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">just 2 pages</span> if possible; this should not be too difficult for new graduates, but can be quite tricky for people with a longer work history.</p>"
