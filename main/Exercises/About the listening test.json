The recordings take about 25 minutes and then you have [field 3] minutes to transfer your answers to the answer paper. You will have only [field 4] chance to hear the recordings except for the example given at the beginning of the test. The recordings will pause briefly for about 20 seconds for you to read the next set of questions, except for in section [field 5], when the recording will play right through with only a few seconds break in the middle.\r\n\r\nIn sections 1 and 2, the recording has a social or semi-formal focus. In sections 3 and 4, the topic is more academic or educational. In Sections 2 and 4 you will generally only have [field 6] main speaker.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of points you should keep in mind when writing your answers. Your [field 7] must be correct (words spelled incorrectly will be marked wrong). You should always keep to the word [field 8] given in the instructions. Writing more words than specified means that your answer will be marked wrong.",
