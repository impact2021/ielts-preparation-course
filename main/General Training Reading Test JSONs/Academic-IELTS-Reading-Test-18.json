In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

The Egyptians, around 3500 BCE, created one of the first timekeeping instruments: the shadow clock or sundial, which used the sun's position to indicate time of day. However, these devices were limited by their dependence on sunlight and clear weather conditions.\n\n<span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>To overcome the limitations of sundials, ancient peoples developed water clocks, or clepsydras. <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">These devices measured time by the regulated flow of water from one container to another</span>, allowing timekeeping to continue regardless of weather or time of day. The Greeks and Romans refined water clock technology, creating elaborate mechanisms with gears and indicators. In China, around 725 CE, the Buddhist monk Yi Xing created an advanced water-powered astronomical clock that could track celestial movements. <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Despite their improvements over sundials, water clocks still faced challenges, as water flow rates could vary with temperature changes</span>.\n\n<span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>The mechanical clock represented a revolutionary advancement in timekeeping technology. <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The first mechanical clocks appeared in European monasteries during the 13th century, driven by falling weights and regulated by an escapement mechanism</span>. These early clocks were large, expensive, and primarily used to regulate prayer times. The invention of the coiled spring in the 15th century enabled the creation of smaller, portable timepieces. <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The mainspring allowed for the development of domestic clocks and eventually watches, making personal timekeeping possible for the first time</span>. However, early mechanical timepieces were notoriously inaccurate, losing or gaining several minutes per day.\n\n<span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>The quest for greater accuracy became particularly urgent with the expansion of maritime exploration. <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Determining longitude at sea required precise timekeeping, as a four-minute error in time measurement could result in a navigational error of one degree longitude, or about 60 nautical miles at the equator</span>. This problem was so critical that the British government established the Longitude Prize in 1714, offering a substantial reward for a reliable solution. John Harrison, an English carpenter and clockmaker, devoted his life to solving this problem, eventually creating the H4 marine chronometer in 1761. <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Harrison's chronometer was accurate to within one-fifth of a second per day, revolutionary precision for the era</span>.\n\nThe 20th century brought dramatic advances in timekeeping accuracy. <span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In 1927, the first quartz clock was developed, utilizing the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals to keep time</span>. When an electric current is applied to a quartz crystal, it vibrates at an extremely consistent frequency. These vibrations can be counted and converted into regular time intervals, providing accuracy far superior to mechanical clocks. Quartz technology eventually miniaturized into the affordable, accurate wristwatches that became ubiquitous by the 1980s.\n\n<span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The development of atomic clocks in 1955 represented the pinnacle of timekeeping precision</span>. These devices measure time based on the oscillations of atoms, typically cesium-133, which vibrates at an extraordinarily stable frequency. Modern atomic clocks are so accurate that they would neither gain nor lose a second in millions of years. In 1967, the definition of a second was officially redefined based on atomic oscillations rather than astronomical observations, reflecting the superior precision of atomic timekeeping. Today, atomic clocks form the basis of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which synchronizes time worldwide and enables technologies such as GPS navigation, telecommunications networks, and financial trading systems that require nanosecond-level precision. Recent developments in optical atomic clocks, which use visible light frequencies rather than microwave frequencies, promise even greater accuracy, potentially losing less than one second over the age of the universe."
