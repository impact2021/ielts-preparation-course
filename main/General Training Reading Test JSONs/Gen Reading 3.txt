    <p>Dear Householder,</p>
    <p><strong>Request for unwanted but useful items for school jumble sale</strong></p>
    <p>As part of this year’s fund-raising event, Edgehill College will be holding a jumble sale on May 24th. All profits will be used to assist in funding of the new children’s play ground in the centre of town.</p>
    <p>We are now requesting donations of unwanted but useful items of usable quality to sell on our jumble sale stalls. We would much appreciate donations in any of the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clothes – Please place washed items in bags or boxes and mark them ‘For Men’, ‘For Women’ or ‘For Children’</li>
      <li>Kitchenware – any items are of use (e.g. plates, cups, glasses, cooking utensils, kitchen equipment such as food mixers etc), currently in short supply.</li>
      <li>Books– complete books (no missing pages), we are especially looking for children’s novels.</li>
      <li>Miscellaneous – Ornaments, pictures, toys, games, handbags etc. Please place in boxes and write the names of the items inside clearly on the box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will also be collecting food which will be donated to the local homeless shelter. If you wish to make a food donation please provide tinned, dried or packet foodstuffs only. Please do not donate food items that are likely to spoil.</p>
    <p>If you are able to, please bring your donated items to the school reception (Monday to Friday between 9.30am and 3.00pm). Otherwise, for larger loads, if you are unable to get to school, we can arrange for a member of the team to collect your items. Please ring 762 8894 and ask to speak to Mr William Taylor our School Liaison Officer who will arrange for one of our volunteer parents to pick up your donation.</p>
    <p>On a final note, we are also still looking for additional volunteers to take care of stalls on the day of the jumble sale. The event will take place between 9.30am and 2pm. If you are free on that day and willing to help out, please contact the Deputy Headmistress Mrs Jayne Browne on 762 8889.</p>
    <p>Thank you in advance for your help and support. We look forward to seeing you on May 24th.</p>
    <p>Best wishes<br>
    Karl Blackman<br>
    Headmaster</p>

    <p>Welcome to the Corbridge teacher training course. Please keep this guide with you throughout the course so you know the structure of what you are studying.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 1</strong><br>
    In the first week, trainees are typically introduced to different teaching methodologies and styles as modelled by your trainers. This first week requires a significant amount of reading and discussion, but at this point you will not be expected to do any teaching.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 2</strong><br>
    During your second week, classroom practice begins. At this stage you will be delivering short lessons to small groups of students. You will not be required to plan the lessons at this point, but you will be observed by your peers. You will also be expected to hand in your first draft of assignment 1 – a lesson plan (at this point you will still be permitted to use published resources).</p>
    <p><strong>Week 3</strong><br>
    At this point comes an intensive study into grammar; although you may know which tenses and voice to use for each situation, you need to develop the ability to actually impart this information in a coherent and learnable manner. For many trainees, it can come as a surprise to find that they actually had no clear understanding of the mechanics of their own language, and this can be as difficult to learn as it is for non-native speakers! You will also be presenting to larger groups of students and will be formally marked on your classroom performance. The first assignment needs to be handed in to your teacher trainers.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 4</strong><br>
    You will deliver five lessons to varying group sizes, ages and on different aspects of the language; each lesson will be monitored and your final grade based on how you are assessed. &nbsp;You will also be required to hand in your second assignment. Remember that, unlike the first assignment, this assignment must be computer typed.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Towards the end of the course, the numbers of lessons trainees have to deliver increases, as does the criticism of their performance. There is a high dropout rate from the third week as many people find the pressure of being assessed by their mentors and their peers too much to handle, and the rate at which trainees leave increases in the following week. If you are feeling under pressure it is important to talk to your teacher trainer immediately.</p>

    <p align="center"><strong>To all staff</strong></p>
    <p>Starting the 3rd of next month, there will be a number training sessions for all staff. Attendance at the first and second session is compulsory, as well as one additional session which you may choose from the remaining options. Please note that seating may be limited so you should arrange with your supervisor which of the sessions you would like to attend.</p>
    <p><strong>Session 1: Dealing with complaints.</strong> Ms Weldgrove will be facilitating this session aimed at making sure that all staff are aware of current office policy regarding complaints. There have been some incidents recently that have not been handled effectively so this session will focus on appropriate procedures when dealing with complaints. As this is a compulsory session, attendance will be high so we will be using the main conference room on the third floor.</p>
    <p><strong>Session 2: Company image.</strong> As you should all be aware, the company is changing its image and branding colours, and this is expected to be completed within the next month. This will require a number of changes to the logo, stationery and uniforms for front-of-house staff. Business cards will be changed, although this is expected to take a little longer. Mark Lorins has organised and will run this training session, focussing on what is expected from your during the changeover period. This will also be held in the conference room on the third floor</p>
    <p><strong>Session 3: Word processing suite.</strong> Gordon Sumner will be offering training in the new word processing software that is being installed in all departments over the next few weeks. There will also be a guest speaker from MacroSwift to introduce the new Visual Presentation software. The session will be in the computer room; there are 70 places available for this seminar so it is recommended you confirm attendance as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>
    <p><strong>Session 4: Internal communication systems.</strong> This is more of a refresher course, in that Jane Williams will be running through policies and procedures for internal messaging that you should already be familiar with. She will be joined by Ruth Madocs from the HR department. Due to space requirements, this session will be held in the conference room in the Logan Hotel.</p>
