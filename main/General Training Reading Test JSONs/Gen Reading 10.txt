Grievance Procedures

A clear employment contract helps reduce workplace grievances, but disagreements may still arise. A formal grievance procedure should be established at the start of employment to manage complaints constructively.

Grievance procedures should be viewed positively by both employers and employees. When poorly handled, they may discourage staff from raising concerns due to fear of retaliation. Research suggests that employees who raise grievances may experience negative outcomes, highlighting the need for protections against backlash.

Grievances should usually be addressed informally first by those directly involved, with escalation possible if required. Alternative resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration may be used when negotiations fail. Effective procedures save time, money and working relationships.
