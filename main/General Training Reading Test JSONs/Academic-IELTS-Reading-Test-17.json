In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "title": "Reading Passage 3 - Urban Agriculture: Growing Food in Cities",
            "content": "A: As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, with the United Nations projecting that 68% of people will live in cities by 2050, the question of how to feed these growing urban populations has become increasingly urgent. Urban agriculture, the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around urban areas, has emerged as a promising solution to multiple challenges facing modern cities. From rooftop gardens and vertical farms to community allotments and hydroponic systems, urban agriculture takes many forms and offers benefits that extend far beyond simple food production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB: The concept of growing food in cities is not new. Throughout history, urban dwellers have maintained gardens and kept livestock within city limits. In ancient Rome, citizens grew vegetables in courtyards and on rooftops. During World War II, \"victory gardens\" in cities across Europe and North America produced a significant portion of the vegetables consumed domestically, <span id=\"q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span>with an estimated <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">40% of American produce coming from such gardens in 1944</span>. However, the post-war period saw a shift toward industrial agriculture and long-distance food supply chains, with food production moving away from urban centers. The recent resurgence of interest in urban agriculture represents both a return to historical practices and an innovation-driven response to contemporary challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC: One of the primary drivers of the urban agriculture movement is food security. Urban farming can increase access to fresh, nutritious food in areas that lack adequate grocery stores or markets, <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>commonly known as \"food deserts.\" These are typically low-income neighborhoods where <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">residents have limited access to affordable, healthy food options</span>. By growing food locally, urban agriculture projects can provide communities with fresh produce while reducing dependence on distant agricultural regions and complex supply chains that can be vulnerable to disruption. <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span>During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">urban farms in many cities proved resilient</span> when conventional food supply chains were disrupted, highlighting the value of localized food production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD: Environmental benefits constitute another compelling argument for urban agriculture. Traditional agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and habitat destruction. The transportation of food over long distances, often referred to as \"food miles,\" significantly increases the carbon footprint of our diets. <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>Urban agriculture <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">reduces these food miles dramatically</span>, with some produce traveling mere meters from production to consumption. Additionally, <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span>urban farms can help manage <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">stormwater runoff</span>, improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and provide green spaces that support biodiversity. Green roofs and vertical gardens can also provide insulation for buildings, reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE: The social and educational impacts of urban agriculture should not be underestimated. <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>Community gardens bring together diverse groups of people, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">fostering social cohesion</span> and providing opportunities for intergenerational knowledge sharing. These spaces often become hubs for community activities, cultural celebrations, and educational programs. <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span>Schools with gardens have reported improved student engagement, better understanding of nutrition and food systems, and <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">enhanced academic performance in science subjects</span>. For children growing up in urban environments, these gardens provide crucial connections to nature and food production that might otherwise be absent from their lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span>F: Despite its numerous benefits, urban agriculture faces significant challenges. Land availability and security are major concerns in cities where property prices are high and vacant land is scarce. Many urban farming initiatives operate on temporary or uncertain land tenure, making long-term planning difficult. <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Soil contamination</span> is another serious issue, particularly in older industrial cities where soil may contain heavy metals or other pollutants that can be absorbed by plants and pose health risks. Water access and quality can also be problematic, as can the initial costs of establishing urban farms, particularly for high-tech solutions like vertical farming or aquaponics systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>G: Economic viability remains a contentious issue in urban agriculture. <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span>While <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">some urban farms operate as successful commercial enterprises</span>, many rely on volunteers, grants, or subsidies to remain operational. The economics are complicated by factors such as high land and labor costs in urban areas, competition with industrial agriculture that benefits from economies of scale, and the challenge of pricing produce competitively while ensuring fair wages and sustainable practices. However, advocates argue that the full value of urban agriculture extends beyond direct financial returns to include social, environmental, and health benefits that are difficult to quantify in purely economic terms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span>H: Technological innovation is opening new possibilities for urban agriculture. Vertical farming, which uses stacked layers of crops in controlled indoor environments, can produce high yields in small footprints. These systems use LED lighting, hydroponics or aeroponics, and climate control to optimize growing conditions and <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>enable <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">year-round production regardless of external weather conditions</span>. While currently energy-intensive and expensive to establish, improvements in technology and renewable energy integration are making these systems increasingly viable. Aquaponics, which combines fish farming with plant growing in a system where they help each other, represents another innovative approach gaining traction in urban settings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI: Looking forward, urban agriculture is likely to play an increasingly important role in sustainable city planning. Many cities worldwide are now incorporating urban agriculture into their official policies and urban development plans. Singapore, for example, <span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span>aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">2030</span>, up from less than 10% currently, through a combination of vertical farms, rooftop gardens, and innovative technologies. Paris has committed to creating 100 hectares of urban agriculture by 2020, including on rooftops and walls. As climate change intensifies, water resources become scarcer, and urban populations continue to grow, the ability to produce food within cities may transition from being a nice-to-have amenity to an essential component of urban resilience and food security."
