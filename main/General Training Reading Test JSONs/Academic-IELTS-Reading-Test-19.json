In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "content": "The Evolution of Writing Systems\n\nWriting systems represent one of humanity's most transformative innovations, fundamentally altering how information is stored, transmitted, and processed across time and space. <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The earliest writing systems emerged independently in several ancient civilizations around 3200 BCE, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica</span>. These systems evolved from simple pictographic representations to complex symbolic frameworks capable of expressing abstract concepts, grammatical structures, and the full range of human thought and experience.\n\nThe Sumerian cuneiform script, developed in ancient Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE, stands as one of the world's oldest writing systems. <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Initially created for record-keeping purposes—tracking grain stores, livestock, and commercial transactions—cuneiform gradually evolved to record laws, literature, and scientific knowledge</span>. <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The name \"cuneiform\" derives from the Latin \"cuneus,\" meaning wedge, referring to the wedge-shaped marks made by pressing a reed stylus into clay tablets</span>. Over centuries, cuneiform transformed from pictographic symbols representing concrete objects to a sophisticated system combining logograms (symbols representing words) and phonetic elements (symbols representing sounds).\n\n<span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Egyptian hieroglyphics emerged roughly contemporaneously with cuneiform but developed quite differently, combining logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements</span>. The term \"hieroglyphics\" means \"sacred carvings\" in Greek, reflecting their prominent use in temples and tombs. Hieroglyphic writing encompassed over 700 distinct signs, including ideograms that represented ideas or objects, phonograms that represented sounds, and determinatives that clarified meaning without representing sounds. <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, proved crucial in deciphering hieroglyphics because it contained the same text in three scripts: hieroglyphic, Demotic, and ancient Greek</span>. French scholar Jean-François Champollion achieved the breakthrough in 1822, unlocking access to three millennia of Egyptian history.\n\nChinese characters represent the world's oldest continuously used writing system, with origins traced to oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE). <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Unlike alphabetic systems that primarily represent sounds, Chinese characters are largely logographic, with each character typically representing a morpheme—a meaningful unit of language</span>. This system offers advantages in representing a language with numerous homophones (words that sound identical but have different meanings) and enables readers who speak mutually unintelligible Chinese dialects to comprehend the same written text. However, literacy requires memorizing thousands of characters; educated individuals typically know 3,000-4,000 characters, while comprehensive dictionaries contain over 50,000.\n\n<span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The development of alphabetic writing systems—where symbols represent individual sounds rather than whole words or concepts—marked a revolutionary simplification in writing technology</span>. The first alphabet, developed by Semitic-speaking peoples in the Levant around 1800 BCE, used symbols for consonant sounds only. <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Phoenician alphabet, which emerged around 1050 BCE with 22 letters representing consonants, became the ancestor of most modern alphabets including Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew</span>. The Greeks made the crucial innovation of adding vowel symbols, creating the first true alphabet representing both consonants and vowels.\n\n<span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Latin alphabet, adapted from the Etruscan alphabet (itself derived from Greek), became the world's most widely used writing system through the expansion of the Roman Empire and later European colonialism</span>. Its 26 letters can represent the sounds of numerous languages, though many languages require additional diacritical marks or modified letters. The Latin alphabet's simplicity and adaptability contributed significantly to its global dominance.\n\n<span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 revolutionized writing's impact by enabling mass production of texts</span>. Before printing, books were laboriously copied by hand, making them expensive and rare. <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Gutenberg's press used movable metal type that could be rearranged and reused, dramatically reducing the cost and time required to produce books</span>. This technological breakthrough facilitated the rapid spread of ideas, contributing to the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution.\n\n<span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In the digital age, writing has undergone another transformation as electronic text replaces physical documents</span>. Digital writing offers unprecedented searchability, editability, and distribution capabilities, while raising new questions about preservation, authenticity, and the nature of authorship. <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Emoji and other visual symbols represent a partial return to pictographic communication, supplementing alphabetic text in digital messaging</span>. As technology continues evolving, writing systems adapt, demonstrating the enduring human need to capture and share ideas across time and distance."
