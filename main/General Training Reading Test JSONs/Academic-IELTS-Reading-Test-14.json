In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "content": "The dawn of culture\n\n<span id=\"passage-q23\" data-question=\"23\"></span>In every society, culturally unique ways of thinking about the world unite people in their behaviour. <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Anthropologists often refer to the body of ideas that people share as ideology. Ideology can be broken down into at least three specific categories: beliefs, values and ideals.</span> People's beliefs give them an understanding of how the world works and how they should respond to the actions of others and their environments. Particular beliefs often tie in closely with the daily concerns of domestic life, such as making a living, health and sickness, happiness and sadness, interpersonal relationships, and death. People's values tell them the differences between right and wrong or good and bad. Ideals serve as models for what people hope to achieve in life.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">There are two accepted systems of belief.</span> Some rely on religion, even the supernatural (things beyond the natural world), to shape their values and ideals and to influence their behaviour. Others base their beliefs on observations of the natural world, a practice anthropologists commonly refer to as secularism.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>Religion in its more extreme form allows people to know about and 'communicate' with supernatural beings, such as animal spirits, gods, and spirits of the dead. Small tribal societies believe that plants and animals, as well as people, can have souls or spirits that can take on different forms to help or harm people. Anthropologists refer to this kind of religious belief as animism, with believers often led by shamans. <span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">As religious specialists, shamans have special access to the spirit world, and are said to be able to receive stories from supernatural beings and later recite them to others or act them out in dramatic rituals.</span>\n\nIn larger, agricultural societies, religion has long been a means of asking for bountiful harvests, a source of power for rulers, or an inspiration to go to war. In early civilised societies, religious visionaries became leaders because people believed those leaders could communicate with the supernatural to control the fate of a civilization. This became their greatest source of power, and people often regarded leaders as actual gods. <span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">For example, in the great civilisation of the Aztec, which flourished in what is now Mexico in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, rulers claimed privileged association with a powerful god that was said to require human blood to ensure that the sun would rise and set each day.</span> <span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>Aztec rulers thus inspired great awe by regularly conducting human sacrifices. They also conspicuously displayed their vast power as wealth in luxury goods, such as fine jewels, clothing and palaces. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Rulers obtained their wealth from the great numbers of craftspeople, traders and warriors under their control, often leaving them with very little in the way of material possessions.</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">During the period in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe known as the Age of Enlightenment, science and logic became new sources of belief for many people living in civilised societies. Scientific studies of the natural world and rational philosophies led people to believe that they could explain natural and social phenomena without believing in gods or spirits. Religion remained an influential system of belief, and together both religion and science drove the development of capitalism</span>, the economic system of commerce-driven market exchange. <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>Capitalism itself influences people's beliefs, values and ideals in many present-day, large, civilised societies. In these societies, such as in the United States, many people view the world and shape their behaviour based on a belief that they can understand and control their environment and that work, commerce and the accumulation of wealth serve an ultimate good. The governments of most large societies today also assert that human well-being derives from the growth of economies and the development of technology.\n\nRapid changes in technology in the last several decades have changed the nature of culture and cultural exchange. People around the world can make economic transactions and transmit information to each other almost instantaneously through the use of computers and satellite communications. Governments and corporations have gained vast amounts of political power through military might and economic influence. Corporations have also created a form of global culture based on worldwide commercial markets. As a result, local culture and social structure are now shaped by large and powerful commercial interests in ways that earlier anthropologists could not have imagined. <span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Early anthropologists thought of societies and their cultures as fully independent systems</span>, but today, many nations are multicultural societies, composed of numerous smaller subcultures. Cultures also cross national boundaries. For instance, people around the world now know a variety of English words and have contact with American cultural exports such as brand-name clothing and technological products, films and music, and mass-produced foods.\n\nIn addition, many people have come to believe in the fundamental nature of human rights and free will. These beliefs grew out of people's increasing ability to control the natural world through science and rationalism, and though religious beliefs continue to change to affirm or accommodate these other dominant beliefs, sometimes the two are at odds with each other. <span id=\"passage-q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">For instance, many religious people have difficulty reconciling their belief in a supreme spiritual force with the theory of natural evolution, which requires no belief in the supernatural.</span> <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span>As a result, societies in which many people do not practice any religion, such as China, may be known as secular societies. However, no society is entirely secular."
