Party in the Park

A
The 6th Annual ‘Party in the Park’ will be held on 22 July at the usual venue, New Lynn Park. This year there will be a number of new features, as well as the traditional stalls, music and games that have made the event popular in previous years.

B
Live music will be provided on two stages throughout the day, with over 20 different bands. Festival favourites Leaning Out will return, along with Irish dancing troupe The Emerald Slippers. New acts include Screener, recently returned from a successful European tour, and Spider Slice, a popular local band.

C
There will be traditional handicraft stalls where visitors can watch local craftspeople and artists at work and purchase unique products. Local artist John Henry will draw portraits on request. The Woodman will sell wooden products and run short wood-craft workshops.

D
There will be a wide range of food and drink stalls, from sandwiches and coffee to ice creams served in pineapple halves and freshly squeezed exotic fruit juices. Visitors will be able to sample products before buying.

E
Additional parking has been arranged. Two car parks are available: Turner Street for stallholders and Judd Road for the general public. An overflow car park on Smith Lane is a 10-minute walk away. Entry is free, but parking costs £1.50 (cash only).

F
The event will proceed regardless of weather conditions. Visitors are advised to bring wet-weather gear if rain is forecast.
