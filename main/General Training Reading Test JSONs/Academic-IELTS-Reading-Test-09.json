In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

      "content": "<h3>Reading Passage 3</h3>\r\n<h4>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27 – 40 which are based on Reading Passage 3.</h4>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Tasmanian Tiger</h2>\r\n<h3>Is the extinct marsupial still roaming the Australian mainland?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Once found throughout continental Australia, as well as the islands of Tasmania and New Guinea, the large, carnivorous marsupial species commonly called the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, is believed to have become extinct in the 1930s. At one time the world's largest <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">marsupial predator</span>, <span id=\"q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the last captive Tasmanian tiger died in Hobart Zoo on the 7th of September, 1936, less than two months after the Tasmanian government had passed a law to protect the animal</span>. However, since that time, there have been hundreds of reported sightings of the Tasmanian tiger in remote locations both on the Australian mainland and in Tasmania. In addition to eyewitness accounts, a number of sightings are supported by photographs and video footage of the animal, although this evidence is considered inconclusive. The thylacine, as the Tasmanian tiger is formally known, continues to be regarded as an extinct species by the scientific community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B:</strong> The Tasmanian tiger's scientific or binomial name, Thylacinus cynocephalus, means \"pouched and dog-headed\". In terms of its physical appearance, the thylacine is described as being a large, shorthaired, doglike animal, with yellow-brown fur, and dark, vertical stripes running down its lower back to the base of the tail, similar to those of a tiger. Its stripy coat earned the thylacine the nickname of Tasmanian tiger. While the thylacine's body resembles that of members of the dog family, with sharp teeth and powerful jaws, <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">it is, in fact, a true pouched marsupial related to the Tasmanian devil</span>. It is thought that the Tasmanian tiger was predominantly quadrupedal, routinely walking on all fours, although captive animals were also observed as being able to stand on their <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">hind legs</span> and hop like a kangaroo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><strong>C:</strong> <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Experts believe that the thylacine most likely became extinct in mainland Australia and New Guinea around 2000 years ago, largely as a result of competition for food with indigenous people and their introduced wild dogs, known as dingoes. At the same time, it has been theorised that a lack of genetic diversity in the thylacine population, due to physical isolation, may have been another cause. As far as the fate of the species on the island state of Tasmania is concerned, a number of reasons have been put forward to explain its decline and subsequent extinction. These include competition with dogs introduced by</span> <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">European settlers</span>, the loss of prey species and natural habitat, disease and hunting. For more than a century, both the Van Diemen's Land Company and the Tasmanian government offered financial rewards, or bounties, on thylacines that were killed, with a view to controlling their numbers to reduce attacks on sheep by Tasmanian tigers. <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Popular belief holds that the thylacine's extinction in Tasmania was largely due to the efforts of farmers and bounty hunters killing the animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D:</strong> Despite the fact that most scientists consider the Tasmanian tiger to be extinct, each year dozens of unconfirmed sightings of the animal are reported from relatively uninhabited areas in New Guinea, Tasmania and mainland Australia by people from all walks of life. However, to date, there has been no conclusive physical evidence of a living thylacine population in any of these locations. On 24 April 1986, the New Scientist magazine made world news when it published a series of colour photographs of an alleged Tasmanian tiger taken by Kevin Cameron, an expert tracker employed with the Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia. The pictures showed a grey animal with fawn stripes, <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">partly hidden</span> from view in wilderness surrounds. <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Subsequent examination raised questions about the photographs' authenticity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><strong>E:</strong> <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Recently, the British daily newspaper The Guardian, along with other media publications, ran a story detailing the plans of a group of scientists from James Cook University to undertake a search for the Tasmanian tiger on the remote Cape York Peninsula in Queensland's far north. The expedition was prompted by a pair of detailed sightings, one from a long-time employee of the Queensland National Parks Service, that appear to be both credible and plausible. While the vast majority of thylacine sightings are dismissed as cases of mistaken identity, where eyewitnesses are said to have seen foxes, dingoes or feral dogs, the Cape York accounts differ in one key detail. Both observers reported that the animals' eyes shone red at night, whereas</span> <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the colour of dogs' and dingoes' eyes shining in torchlight is green</span>. In addition, the size, shape and behaviour of the creatures, as described by the Cape York eyewitnesses, were not consistent with those of other large species found in north Queensland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>F:</strong> The two James Cook University researchers undertaking the Cape York expedition, Professor Bill Laurance and Doctor Sandra Abell, have stated that they will set up more than fifty <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">trail cameras</span> in the area of the sightings, one to two kilometres apart, in the hopes of photographing a live Tasmanian tiger. Isolated, uninhabited and not very extensively explored, the Cape York Peninsula in Australia's northeast is known to be home to a number of endangered species that are not found anywhere else on the continent. The traps will be baited with a scent that is attractive to predatory species, and the research team plan to check the cameras every few weeks and download the data, with a view to gathering photographic evidence of living thylacines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><strong>G:</strong> <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">While Laurance admits that the chance of rediscovering the Tasmanian tiger alive in north Queensland is very slim, given that it is unlikely that the species could survive in such low numbers, he</span> <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">believes that there exists a remote possibility of between 1 and 2% that the creature could persist in Cape York</span>. Jack Ashby, manager of the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London, shares this view. \"It's not impossible\", he says.</p>"
