<p>‘cycling tours of NZ can cater to your needs.’ (Paragraph D mentions that Aotearoa is the Maori name for NZ)</p>
<p>9. vi</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Ornithologists’ are bird watchers </li>
<li>the nesting areas of our native birds and the north island gannet colony of Muriwai.’ </li>
<li>Guest lecturers will also give an insight into the now extinct species – the Great Moa – the largest bird ever known to have lived on our shores. </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: vii (‘The History of the Moa’) is NOT the correct answer as this refers to only one species of bird</p>
<p>10. ii</p>
<p>‘not reliant on transport ….A reasonable fitness level is required though no steep paths or climbing is involved (tramping is a New Zealand word for hiking).</p>
<p>11. viii</p>
<p>The paragraph talks about the natural world. Flora and fauna means ‘ animals and plants’. The tour is educational (involving lectures).</p>
<p>12. ix</p>
<p>The paragraph refers to ‘thermal phenomenon’ </p>
<p>NOTE: iv (‘The Traditional Culture of Rotorua ‘) is NOT the correct answer as the paragraph talks about the natural world, not culture.</p>
<p>13. i</p>
<p>‘we partake in some of the best food and beverages New Zealand has to offer. Visit 5 of the country’s largest exporting vineyards…’ </p>
<p>14. iii</p>
<p>The paragraph refers to ‘off road travel’ and ‘custom made jeeps’, also adding that ‘We will soon also be offering excursions in the northern tip of the North island.’ (therefore <strong><em>South Island Extravaganza</em></strong> and NOT <strong><em>Northern Exposure)</em></strong></p>

    <p align="center"><strong>Language Express Student Prospectus</strong></p>
    <strong>A:</strong> Language Express provides students with access to a state-of-the-art computer laboratory, extensive library, comfortable and tranquil private study area and Language Support Tutors in the Learning Support Centre. Should you be experiencing any difficulties with your course, make an appointment with a tutor and they will be able to offer you one-to-one advice and help you plan a study schedule and access resources to assist you in meeting your learning goals.
    <p class="style1"><strong>B:</strong> Members are elected by their peers at the beginning of each academic year. They are on hand to communicate between the student body and academic and management staff of the school. Their role is to keep us informed of any requests or complaints from our students that may not be raised on an individual level. Members often also recommend social activities and are active in ensuring that everyone also enjoys their recreation time.</p>
    <strong>C:</strong> As far as we are aware, we are the only institution in our city that has such extensive links with industry. We are able to place our students in work experience positions during semester breaks which provide you with an opportunity to gain valuable work experience which will differentiate you from other applicants and help you to secure the employment position you deserve.

    <strong>D:</strong> Language Express was established in 1990 and cooperates with 10 other prestigious education institutions in various countries. Graduates from our business programmes are able to cross-credit their courses into a number of nominated courses on offer at our sister institutions. Our goal is to provide quality education to our students and to assist them in achieving their goals.

    <strong>E:</strong> Students of any level can join our classes; we offer instruction from beginner to advanced level. During Orientation, one of the first priorities is to arrange a test for our students so that we know which class is most suitable for them. Our weekly tests will allow you to measure your progress for yourself. Many of our students go on to enroll in one of our professional qualification courses; but whatever your interest or goals we can help you fulfil your potential.

    <strong>F:</strong> Several courses are assessed purely via assignments and presentations; however, should your course involve a final test, they are held two weeks after lectures finish – this means you have a two week period in which to prepare and revise. Graduation ceremonies are held twice a year; the largest being in April and smaller ceremony in November for students who successfully finish at the end of Semester 2.

    <strong>G:</strong> Semester start dates for business courses vary slightly from year to year (dates for this year and the following year are found on our website). There are three semesters each year (though students may decide to study for only two terms and take a summer school holiday). The language school intake is more flexible and students are able to begin their course on any Monday apart from in December when the institution closes for a three week holiday.

<p align="center"><strong>Language Express Student Prospectus</strong></p>
<p>    <strong>A:</strong> Language Express provides students with access to a state-of-the-art computer laboratory, extensive library, comfortable and tranquil private study area and Language Support Tutors in the Learning Support Centre. Should you be experiencing any difficulties with your course, make an appointment with a tutor and they will be able to offer you one-to-one advice and help you plan a study schedule and access resources to assist you in meeting your learning goals.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>B:</strong> Members are elected by their peers at the beginning of each academic year. They are on hand to communicate between the student body and academic and management staff of the school. Their role is to keep us informed of any requests or complaints from our students that may not be raised on an individual level. Members often also recommend social activities and are active in ensuring that everyone also enjoys their recreation time.</p>
<p>    <strong>C:</strong> As far as we are aware, we are the only institution in our city that has such extensive links with industry. We are able to place our students in work experience positions during semester breaks which provide you with an opportunity to gain valuable work experience which will differentiate you from other applicants and help you to secure the employment position you deserve.</p>
<p>    <strong>D:</strong> Language Express was established in 1990 and cooperates with 10 other prestigious education institutions in various countries. Graduates from our business programmes are able to cross-credit their courses into a number of nominated courses on offer at our sister institutions. Our goal is to provide quality education to our students and to assist them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p>    <strong>E:</strong> Students of any level can join our classes; we offer instruction from beginner to advanced level. During Orientation, one of the first priorities is to arrange a test for our students so that we know which class is most suitable for them. Our weekly tests will allow you to measure your progress for yourself. Many of our students go on to enroll in one of our professional qualification courses; but whatever your interest or goals we can help you fulfil your potential.</p>
<p>    <strong>F:</strong> Several courses are assessed purely via assignments and presentations; however, should your course involve a final test, they are held two weeks after lectures finish – this means you have a two week period in which to prepare and revise. Graduation ceremonies are held twice a year; the largest being in April and smaller ceremony in November for students who successfully finish at the end of Semester 2.</p>
<p>    <strong>G:</strong> Semester start dates for business courses vary slightly from year to year (dates for this year and the following year are found on our website). There are three semesters each year (though students may decide to study for only two terms and take a summer school holiday). The language school intake is more flexible and students are able to begin their course on any Monday apart from in December when the institution closes for a three week holiday.
