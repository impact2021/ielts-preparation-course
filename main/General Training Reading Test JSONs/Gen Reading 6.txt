Charity Fun Run – Moorfields School

Dear Supporter,

I am writing to invite you to join us for our Annual Fun Run which will be held this year on Sunday 18th August. The run starts from the school grounds and participants are able to choose to take part in a 2, 5 or 10 kilometre run.

Last year we raised a total of $15,450, which was donated to the children’s hospital, and this year we expect to raise $16,000. This year, the money raised will be used to develop the village recreational centre.

To confirm your registration, email funrunsuccess@edu.com
 or telephone 01784 5337841. As soon as you are registered, you simply start collecting your sponsors and come along on the day.
