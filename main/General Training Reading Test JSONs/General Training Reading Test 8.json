            "content": "<h3>Reading Passage 3</h3>\r\n<h2>The price of your newspaper</h2>\r\n\r\n<h4>Paragraph A</h4>\r\n<p>The average family buys two newspapers and a magazine every week, in addition to receiving up to three pieces of junk mail. Multiplied by the global population, this amounts to a lot of paper, and therefore a lot of wood. Although the rise of the home computer has gone a long way in reducing this excessive use of paper, the demand is still considerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span>Paragraph B</h4>\r\n<p>Social and economic concerns have over-ridden environmental common sense, and in many western countries, the woods and forests that once covered the land have long since been cleared away. A shocking example can be found by looking at the <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">United States</span>, which now has less than two per cent of its original forest. Other areas, predominantly tropical countries, are now following the same destructive path. In 1995 over one million hectares of forest in Brazil were cleared, a disturbing statistic but nonetheless inevitable as timber and other related raw materials are important exports for countries that often have little other way of supporting themselves. They provide employment for those who harvest the wood, extract rubber or make products using available materials. With one third of the world depending on wood for fuel, it is very tempting, though shortsighted, for poorer countries to exploit the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span>Paragraph C</h4>\r\n<p>It could be argued, then, that countries with rich wood resources should be fully entitled to exploit them. However, there are less destructive alternatives for generating an income from the rainforests. The forest environment provides a popular setting for ecotourism, which includes hiking, camping, bird watching and other outdoor adventure or nature study activities. <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">International travel</span> is becoming increasingly popular, making the rainforests accessible for the more adventurous holidaymaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span>Paragraph D</h4>\r\n<p>No matter what the solution, the rampant spread of deforestation has to be halted. Surveys in Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Liberia found that forest wildlife accounted for 70 to 90 per cent of the total animal protein consumed, thus arguing that some indigenous peoples are completely dependent on forests for food. In many of these countries, wood harvesting is carried out on a considerably more sensible scale. There appears to be the realisation that selling the wood is a temporary solution that would inevitably lead to worse problems for the future. Not only would the traditional food source be gone, but the trees which protected the soil against erosion would be gone. Landslides would become more common and rainwater would not be absorbed so easily into the ground, leading to a shortage of freshwater supplies. There is also the global impact, not only from the burning of the wood but also because trees provide an important role in the recycling of carbon dioxide and the production of oxygen. Estimates based on the current rate of deforestation have predicted a 15 per cent rise in <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the greenhouse effect</span> around the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>Paragraph E</h4>\r\n<p>In order to combat the problem of deforestation, it is important to consider its causes in greater detail. In Brazil, we should look at the unequal and unfair distribution of land – 4.5 per cent of landowners hold 81 per cent of the country's farmland, and 70 per cent of rural households are <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">landless</span>. With either no legal claim to the land or ownership of so much, deforestation is inevitable as land owners profit from the land. This is the point in which the situation is in the hands of government, yet often the landowners have shown their ability to sway official regulations regarding timber harvesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>Paragraph F</h4>\r\n<p>To effect a serious reversal of the damage, some governments are taking a more active role in forest management to protect the environment and employment – a change which has been largely encouraged by the voting and demands of the general population which have resulted in policies of replantation and protection. As well as creating political pressure, individuals can make a difference by practising green consumerism. Recycled paper is readily available, and we can all make an effort to purchase the most ecologically sensitive products. Demanding alternative products, such as clear-cut free paper and eco-certified lumber, is important in convincing companies that markets exist for such products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>Paragraph G</h4>\r\n<p>None of these activities can occur without the raising of <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">public awareness</span> to inform consumers about the environmental effects of their products, and this is not an easy task. Many people are too entrenched in their habits or too lazy to change, yet one of the most important ways for a person to have a positive effect is to reduce his or her consumption of forest and related products. An increase in the participation of the public in, and the accessibility and productiveness of facilities for, reducing, reusing and recycling is not only necessary, but also a duty. So next time you buy a newspaper, just consider the cost.</p>",
