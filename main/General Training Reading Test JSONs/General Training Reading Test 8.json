However, with proper preparation and a professional approach, salary negotiations can be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Before You Start</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q15\" data-question=\"15\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Research industry salary standards for your position, experience level, and geographic location before initiating any discussion with your manager</span>. This ensures your request is realistic and backed by data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q16\" data-question=\"16\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Document your achievements and contributions over the past year, including successful projects, additional responsibilities you have assumed, and positive feedback from colleagues or clients</span>. This evidence strengthens your case considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose an appropriate time to request a meeting—ideally after a successful project completion, during performance reviews, or when the company is performing well financially.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Negotiation Meeting</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q17\" data-question=\"17\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Start the conversation by thanking your manager for considering your request and expressing your commitment to the organization</span>. This sets a positive tone for the discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q18\" data-question=\"18\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Present your case clearly by explaining why you deserve a raise, focusing on the value you bring to the company rather than personal financial needs</span>. Mention specific accomplishments and how you have improved efficiency or contributed to company goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen carefully to your manager's feedback. They may outline concerns, budget constraints, or offer alternative benefits such as additional vacation days or flexible working arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>After the Discussion</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q19\" data-question=\"19\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">If your manager needs time to consider, request a follow-up meeting within two weeks to discuss their decision</span>. Agree on a specific date before the meeting concludes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q20\" data-question=\"20\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Even if your initial request is declined, ask what specific improvements or achievements would make you eligible for a raise in the future, and establish clear goals to work towards</span>. This demonstrates your commitment to professional growth and keeps the door open for future negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that negotiation is a normal business practice, and most employers expect employees to request pay increases periodically.</p>"

Use a standard business font such as Arial or Times New Roman in size 11 or 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q22\" data-question=\"22\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Include your contact information at the top of the letter, followed by the date, and then the employer's name and company address</span>. Address the letter to a specific person whenever possible; research the hiring manager's name on the company website or LinkedIn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Content Guidelines</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q23\" data-question=\"23\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The opening paragraph should mention the specific position you are applying for and where you found the job listing</span>. This shows that you have tailored your application to this particular opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q24\" data-question=\"24\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In the main body, explain why you are interested in the company and the role, highlighting how your skills and experience match the job requirements</span>. Use specific examples from your background to demonstrate your qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid repeating information that is already in your CV. Instead, add value by explaining your genuine interest in the position and what you can contribute to the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Closing Statements</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Conclude with a strong closing paragraph that expresses your enthusiasm for the opportunity and includes a call to action, such as requesting an interview</span>. Thank the reader for their time and consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Sign off professionally with \"Sincerely\" or \"Best regards\" followed by your full name typed below, leaving space for your handwritten signature if submitting a printed copy</span>. Proofread carefully for spelling and grammar errors before sending.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not use generic cover letters. Each letter should be customized for the specific position and company. Avoid using informal language or jokes that may not be appropriate in a professional context. Never include negative comments about previous employers.</p>"

            "content": "<h3>Reading Passage 3</h3>\r\n<h2>The price of your newspaper</h2>\r\n\r\n<h4>Paragraph A</h4>\r\n<p>The average family buys two newspapers and a magazine every week, in addition to receiving up to three pieces of junk mail. Multiplied by the global population, this amounts to a lot of paper, and therefore a lot of wood. Although the rise of the home computer has gone a long way in reducing this excessive use of paper, the demand is still considerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><h4><span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span>Paragraph B</h4>\r\n<p>Social and economic concerns have over-ridden environmental common sense, and in many western countries, the woods and forests that once covered the land have long since been cleared away. A shocking example can be found by looking at the <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">United States</span>, which now has less than two per cent of its original forest. Other areas, predominantly tropical countries, <span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>are now following the same destructive path. In 1995 over one million hectares of forest in Brazil were cleared, a disturbing statistic but nonetheless inevitable as timber and other related raw materials are important exports for countries that often have little other way of supporting themselves. They provide employment for those who harvest the wood, extract rubber or make products using available materials. With one third of the world depending on wood for fuel, it is very tempting, <span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>though shortsighted, for poorer countries to exploit the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span>Paragraph C</h4>\r\n<p>It could be argued, then, that countries with rich wood resources should be fully entitled to exploit them. However, there are less destructive alternatives for generating an income from the rainforests. The forest environment provides a popular setting for ecotourism, which includes hiking, camping, bird watching and other outdoor adventure or<span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span> nature study activities. <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">International travel</span> is becoming increasingly popular, making the rainforests accessible for the more adventurous holidaymaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span>Paragraph D</h4>\r\n<p>No matter what the solution, the rampant spread of deforestation has to be halted. Surveys in Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, G<span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>hana and Liberia found that forest wildlife accounted for 70 to 90 per cent of the total animal protein consumed, thus arguing that some indigenous peoples are completely dependent on forests for food. In many of these countries, wood harvesting is carried out on a considerably more sensible scale. There appears to be the realisation that selling the wood is a temporary solution that would inevitably lead to worse problems for the future. Not only would the traditional food source be gone, but the trees which protected the soil a<span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>gainst erosion would be gone. Landslides would become more common and rainwater would not be absorbed so easily into the ground, leading to a shortage of freshwater supplies. There is also the global impact, not only from the burning of the wood but also because trees provide an important role in the recycling of carbon dioxide and the production of oxygen. Estimates based on the current rate of deforestation have predicted a 15 per cent rise in <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"><span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the greenhouse effect</span> around the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>Paragraph E</h4>\r\n<p>In order to combat the problem of deforestation, it is important to consider its causes in greater detail. In Brazil, we should look at the unequal and unfair distribution of land – 4.5 per cent of landowners hold 81 per cent of the country's farmland, and 70 per cent <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span>of rural households are <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">landless</span>. With either no legal claim to the land or ownership of so much, deforestation is inevitable as land owners profit from the land. This is the point in which the situation is in the hands of government, yet often the landowners have shown their ability to sway official regulations regarding timber harvesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>Paragraph F</h4>\r\n<p>To effect a serious reversa<span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span>l of the damage, some governments are taking a more active role in forest management to protect the environment and employment – a change which has been largely encouraged by the voting and demands of the general population which have resulted in policies of replantation and protection. As well as creating political pressure, individuals can make a difference by practising green consumerism. Recycled paper is readily available, and we can all make an effort to purchase the most ecologica<span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span>lly sensitive products. Demanding alternative products, such as clear-cut free paper and eco-certified lumber, is important in convincing companies that markets exist for such products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>Paragraph G</h4>\r\n<p>None of these activities can occur without the raising of <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">public awareness</span> to inform consumers about the environmental effects of the<span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span>ir products, and this is not an easy task. Many people are too entrenched in their habits or too lazy to change, yet one of the most important ways for a person to have a positive effect is to reduce his or her consumption of forest and related products. An increase in the participation of the public in, and the accessibility and productiveness of facilities for, reducing, reusing and recycling is not only necessary, but also a duty. So next time you buy a newspaper, just consider the cost.</p>",
