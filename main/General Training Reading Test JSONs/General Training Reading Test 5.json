      "content": "<p align=\"center\"><strong>Dressed for work</strong></p>\n    <p>For some people, especially when starting in a new job, the decision of how to dress can be a difficult one. Dress too casually, and your colleagues and employer can get the impression that you are not taking the role seriously and your future prospects within the company can rapidly narrow. Dress too formally and colleagues may take this as a sign that you have too high an opinion of your role, that you are not relaxed and won’t be much fun to work with.</p>\n    <p>If possible, always check the dress code after you have been offered a position. In fact, when attending interviews, take the opportunity to see what others around are wearing. However, there are some useful tips to help you get started.</p>\n    <p>The rules for men are generally quite simple – in an office based environment, dark trousers, shoes and a simple shirt are generally acceptable. On the first day, you can wear a tie but be alert to the people around you. If you are the only one wearing a tie, you might want to reconsider on your second day. Take a suit jacket in case the workplace is formal, but you may not want to wear it.</p>\n    <p>For women, the situation can be a little more complicated.

Dress too casually, and your colleagues and employer can get the impression that you are not taking the role seriously and your future prospects within the company can rapidly narrow. Dress too formally and colleagues may take this as a sign that you have too high an opinion of your role, that you are not relaxed and won’t be much fun to work with.</p>\n<p>If possible, always check the dress code after you have been offered a position. In fact, when attending interviews, take the opportunity to see what others around are wearing. However, there are some useful tips to help you get started.</p>\n<p>The rules for men are generally quite simple – in an office based environment, dark trousers, shoes and a simple shirt are generally acceptable. On the first day, you can wear a tie but be alert to the people around you. If you are the only one wearing a tie, you might want to reconsider on your second day. Take a suit jacket in case the workplace is formal, but you may not want to wear it.</p>\n<p>For women, the situation can be a little more complicated. In some companies, a sleeveless top may be considered acceptable and in others it may lead to suggestions that you are under-dressed.

      "content": "<p><strong>Training and development</strong></p>\n    <span>Traditionally, training and development was instigated as a direct result of identifying a weakness or area that requires improvement, largely because of information gathered from staff appraisals. However, in more recent years, the concept of training as a tool for positive growth, expansion and development has become far more common.</span>\n    <span>The potential for employees to upskill with training is used as a way of retaining staff who may have otherwise looked for opportunities with other companies. Learning new skills that can be applied in the workplace tends to make employees feel more motivated and more highly valued within the company. There is also an element of training involved when a company expands and diversifies. Not wishing to employ new staff, many companies now opt to train existing staff in new areas rather than advertise externally.</span>\n    <span>However, perhaps the most pressing need for training has come about due to changing technologies in the workplace. Some 50 years back, a secretary may have required some typing training at the commencement of their employment and this was sufficient for them right up to the point of retirement. These days, knowledge of word processing software and other peripherals such as handheld devices and conference calling equipment all need to be learned and regularly updated. For many companies, it is essential for staff to remain abreast of changes in technology as this may prove to be a point of comparison with other companies, with the significant risk of losing business.</span>\n    <span>There are a number of common areas that staff may require training in. There is, as previously mentioned, a technological imperative to training, but there are also other factors to be considered. Customer service training, for example, is prioritised in the majority of industries, as increased competition in today’s global marketplace makes it critical that employees understand and meet the needs of customers. Also related to global workplace, training in understanding and working in ethnically diverse companies has also become a common form of training. These training seminars focus on how people have different perspectives and views, and include techniques to value diversity, thus offering a significant advantage to the company.</span>\n    <span>With increasingly tight government regulations in place to protect employees, health and safety training has also become a significant part of any training and development programme. Risk management, correct procedures and basic first aid, especially in industries with heavy equipment or dangerous working environment is becoming increasingly important. Training and development, as previously mentioned, is significant in the retention of key staff as it leads to increased job satisfaction and morale among employees. This in turn leads to a general feeling of motivation among staff, and the feeling that the company is interested in their wellbeing and development. There are, of course, improvements in efficiency, but also in innovation and employee support of the company. The image of the company also benefits, as better trained staff reflect well on the employer.</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"ito-scroll-box\">"

      "content": "DWARF PLANET<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Discovery, Classification and Exploration of Pluto<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A: </strong><span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">On the 14th of July, 2015, a NASA deep space probe called New Horizons flew through <span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the Pluto system in the Kuiper belt</span>, located almost 6 billion kilometres from our sun</span>, gathering high resolution photographs of the dwarf planet and its moons. Scientifically, the aims of the New Horizons mission were to provide experts on Earth with greater detail regarding the geomorphology, atmosphere, magnetosphere and surface composition of Pluto. As well as cameras for high resolution imagery, the spacecraft used an array of on-board scientific equipment to obtain information, including remote sensors, radio transmitters, computer subsystems, a large satellite dish and a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>B: </strong>Pluto was discovered in February, 1930, by the American Charles Tombaugh, a young self-taught astronomer working at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Tombaugh, then in his early twenties, detected the existence of the planet by examining anomalies in photographic plates with the aid of a special viewing apparatus known as a blink microscope. His discovery soon made worldwide news headlines, and on the 25th of May, 1930, the members of the Lowell Observatory chose the name of Pluto for the ninth planet in the Solar System by unanimous vote. The name itself comes from that of the Roman god of the underworld, and was suggested by a schoolgirl living in England, whose uncle, a retired university librarian, had passed on her suggestion through academic acquaintances. <span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">It has been rumoured that Pluto's discovery served as inspiration for Walt Disney's canine character of the same name</span>. There is, however, no question surrounding the naming of the element plutonium, which was named after the planet following the creation of the former by a team of scientists at the University of California in the early 1940s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>C: </strong>The estimated mass of Pluto was steadily revised downwards in the decades following its discovery, and was not accurately calculated until 1978, the same year in which Charon, the largest of the planet's five moons, was discovered by the United States Naval Observatory astronomer James Christy. While the original estimate of Pluto's mass had been seven times that of Earth, Christy and his colleague, Robert Harrington, compared Charon's orbital period and size with those of Pluto, estimating the planet's mass to be approximately 0.2 per cent that of the earth. A pair of smaller satellites, Nix and Hydra, was subsequently identified in 2005, with <span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the final two of Pluto's known moons, named Kerberos and Styx, being discovered in 2011 and 2012 respectively</span>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>D: </strong>However, in spite of having been regarded as the ninth planet in the solar system for more than fifty years, Pluto's status and classification began to come into question towards the close of the twentieth century. Initially, this was due to the fact that during the nineties a number of objects, made of rock and ice and of a similar size to Pluto, were discovered lying within the Kuiper belt, a circumstellar disc, in many ways resembling a gigantic asteroid belt, at the edge of the Solar System beyond Neptune. The first of these new Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) was identified in 1992 by a pair of astronomers, David Jewitt and Jane Luu, working out of the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Many more Kuiper Belt Objects were found in the years that followed, making Pluto's official status as a planet increasingly controversial among many in the scientific community. While Pluto remains, at present, the largest of the known trans-Neptunian objects located in the Kuiper belt, the discovery in 2005 of a minor planet with a greater mass, Eris, in an outlying region of the Kuiper belt known as the scattered disc, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to create a formal definition of the term \"planet\" that excluded Pluto.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>E: </strong>When the New Horizons interplanetary space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral in January, 2006, its primary mission was to voyage to Pluto, at that time the only remaining unexplored planet in the Solar System. However, in August of the same year, at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) held in the Czech Republic, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet on account of the fact that it did not meet one of the three formal conditions required to be classed as a planet. According to the official definition of the IAU, a planet must be in orbit around the sun and have sufficient mass both for its own gravity to make it spherical in shape and <span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">to have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects. Failing to meet the third of these criteria, Pluto was classified as a \"dwarf planet\"</span>. While the decision of the IAU to reduce the number of planets in the Solar System from nine to eight has received its fair share of both praise and criticism, the definition of Pluto as a dwarf planet, while controversial, remains in use. Today, there are five known bodies in the Solar System that have been recognised by the IAU as dwarf planets. In addition to Pluto, these are Ceres, Haumea, Makemake and Eris. At the same time, it has been estimated that there may be hundreds more as yet undiscovered and unclassified dwarf planets throughout the Solar System.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>F: </strong>The high resolution images of Pluto made during the New Horizons close flyby of the planet and beamed back to Earth from across the Solar System have revealed a unique terrain. Far from being a flat, dead world, the rocky dwarf planet's surface contains a multitude of varied, complex landscapes, ranging from oddly-textured ridges with the appearance of tree bark or dragon scales, ice cliffs, valleys and mountains and frozen lakes and oceans to heavily cratered and pitted plains. Experts theorise that, <span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">in addition to the impact of other space bodies colliding with the planet, the majority of its terrain has been shaped by a combination of ice sublimation and tectonic forces</span>. While still awaiting official approval from the International Astronomical Union, names for a number of Pluto's regions and topographical features have already been proposed by the New Horizons discovery team in consultation with the general public, including Tombaugh Regio, the Brass Knuckles, Tartarus Dorsa and Cthulhu Regio, the latter named after a fictional deity from the works of American author H.P. Lovecraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>G: </strong>Irrespective of its official present classification as a dwarf planet, the New Horizons reconnaissance of Pluto provides a wealth of knowledge and data regarding the last major body in the Solar System not previously visited by a space probe. While the planet, spacecraft and New Horizons team may be comparatively small, the mission to the Pluto system not only represents the culmination of more than a decade's worth of preparation on Earth, but also the beginning of a new chapter in space exploration at the edge of the Solar System and beyond.",
