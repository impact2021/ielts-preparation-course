Dressed for Work

Choosing what to wear at work can be difficult, particularly when starting a new job. Dressing too casually may give the impression that you are not taking your role seriously, while dressing too formally can make colleagues think you are unapproachable.

If possible, check the dress code after being offered a position. When attending interviews, observe what other employees are wearing.

For men, dark trousers, shoes and a simple shirt are generally acceptable. Wearing a tie on the first day is fine, but it may be unnecessary if no one else is wearing one.

For women, expectations vary widely, so observing colleagues in similar roles is often the best guide.

In many countries, especially in large corporations, there has been a move towards stricter dress codes, including uniforms for management.

Other useful advice includes choosing conservative colours, avoiding large jewellery, maintaining good hygiene, and avoiding clothing with obvious designer logos.
