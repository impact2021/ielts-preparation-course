<h3>The Appliance Store sale!</h3>
</div>
From March 1st to March 8th, The Appliance Store will be having its third annual clearance sale. Prices will be slashed to as much as 50% of normal retail price. Household brands going for crazy prices!

The sale begins at 8.00 a.m. on March 1st. The first 100 customers through the door will have a further 20% discounted from their purchase, so we recommend you get here earlier to avoid disappointment.
<h4>Computers</h4>
Desktop computers will be on sale, with reductions of up to 50% on all major brands. Laptops will also be heavily reduced – pick one up for less than £200 including carry case and wireless mouse! Computer accessories will also be on sale, with keyboards, monitors and other accessories also heavily discounted.

Our knowledgeable and friendly staff are on hand to advise you about the best computer for your needs. We even have our free 20 minute training sessions to get you started using your new computer, so even if you are a first time computer owner, we have something for you!

All PC Technology computers come with a standard 12 month guarantee (24 months for any model over £1000) to give you peace of mind when buying your new machine.
<h4>Kitchen appliances</h4>
Fridges, freezers, microwaves, and toasters will all be on sale, with combination packages (buy two kitchen items for a bigger discount) making this our greatest sale yet! Even the stainless steel appliances are hugely reduced to make way for new stock.
<h4>Televisions</h4>
Flat screen LCD and plasma televisions are also reduced, with some brands as much as 30% off! We have a limited stock on televisions, so come early to secure a bargain! We have the new Panasonic Viera II with internal DVD player for the lowest price in town.

<h3>Holiday Entitlement</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>All employees are entitled to a minimum of&nbsp;5.6 weeks paid annual leave (28 days for someone working&nbsp;five days a&nbsp;week).</li>
 	<li>Part-time workers are entitled to the same level of holiday pro rata (so 5.6 times your usual working week, e.g. 22.4 days for someone working four days a week)</li>
 	<li>You start building up holiday as soon as you start work</li>
 	<li>The company has the right to refuse holiday applications on unless 6 weeks’ notice is given in writing.</li>
 	<li>You get paid your normal pay for your holiday</li>
 	<li>Holidays may not be exchanged for payment, unless you will no longer be working for the company</li>
 	<li>Public holidays are included in your minimum entitlement</li>
 	<li>You continue to be entitled to your holiday leave in addition to any maternity (or paternity) leave. See below for maternity/paternity leave.</li>
 	<li>Holidays can be accumulated over multiple years to a maximum of 8 weeks. Any additional holiday beyond this must be taken or lost; no payment will be made for holiday time an employee does not take</li>
 	<li>In the event of a public holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the following Monday</li>
</ul>
<h4>Compassionate leave</h4>
In the event of a death or serious illness or emergency involving a ‘dependant’ in the family, employees are also entitled to compassionate leave. A dependant could be your husband, wife, partner, child, parent, or anyone living in your household as a member of the family. A dependant may also be anyone who reasonably relies on you for help in an emergency, for example an elderly neighbour living alone who falls and breaks a leg and you are the closest on hand.
You are allowed ‘reasonable’ time off to deal with the emergency and make any arrangements that are needed. There’s no limit to the number of times you can take time off for dependants. However, if the company feels that this is being abused, an investigation may be instigated.
Note that payment for compassionate leave is discretionary, and in most cases the company will continue to pay normal wages, but this should first be confirmed in writing with your manager or supervisor.
<h4>Maternity and paternity leave</h4>
Statutory Maternity Leave is for 52 weeks, although mothers-to-be are only entitled to receive Maternity pay for the first 38 weeks of the leave. To claim maternity leave, you must satisfy the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>notify the company in writing 28 days before the commencement of the leave</li>
 	<li>have been employed continuously by the company at least 26 weeks before the baby is due</li>
 	<li>leave can only be taken 11 weeks before the week your baby is due</li>
</ul>
If you are a father-to-be or you will be responsible with the mother for bringing up a child, you could have the right to paternity leave and pay, providing you meet the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>You must be taking the time off to support the mother or carer for the baby and intend to be fully involved in their upbringing.</li>
 	<li>Have been employed continuously by the company at least 26 weeks before the baby is due</li>
 	<li>The leave is taken on or after the day the baby is born</li>
 	<li>Paternity leave has to finish within 56 days of the baby being born.</li>
