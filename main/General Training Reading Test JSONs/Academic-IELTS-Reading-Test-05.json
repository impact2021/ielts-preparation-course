In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

      "title": "Reading Passage 3 - Dwarf Planet",
      "content": "DWARF PLANET<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Discovery, Classification and Exploration of Pluto<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A: </strong><span id=\"q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">On the 14th of July, 2015, a NASA deep space probe called New Horizons flew through <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the Pluto system in the Kuiper belt</span>, located almost 6 billion kilometres from our sun</span>, gathering high resolution photographs of the dwarf planet and its moons. Scientifically, the aims of the New Horizons mission were to provide experts on Earth with greater detail regarding the geomorphology, atmosphere, magnetosphere and surface composition of Pluto. As well as cameras for high resolution imagery, the spacecraft used an array of on-board scientific equipment to obtain information, including remote sensors, radio transmitters, computer subsystems, a large satellite dish and a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>B: </strong>Pluto was discovered in February, 1930, by the American Charles Tombaugh, a young self-taught astronomer working at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Tombaugh, then in his early twenties, detected the existence of the planet by examining anomalies in photographic plates with the aid of a special viewing apparatus known as a blink microscope. His discovery soon made worldwide news headlines, and on the 25th of May, 1930, the members of the Lowell Observatory chose the name of Pluto for the ninth planet in the Solar System by unanimous vote. The name itself comes from that of the Roman god of the underworld, and was suggested by a schoolgirl living in England, whose uncle, a retired university librarian, had passed on her suggestion through academic acquaintances. <span id=\"q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">It has been rumoured that Pluto's discovery served as inspiration for Walt Disney's canine character of the same name</span>. There is, however, no question surrounding the naming of the element plutonium, which was named after the planet following the creation of the former by a team of scientists at the University of California in the early 1940s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>C: </strong>The estimated mass of Pluto was steadily revised downwards in the decades following its discovery, and was not accurately calculated until 1978, the same year in which Charon, the largest of the planet's five moons, was discovered by the United States Naval Observatory astronomer James Christy. While the original estimate of Pluto's mass had been seven times that of Earth, Christy and his colleague, Robert Harrington, compared Charon's orbital period and size with those of Pluto, estimating the planet's mass to be approximately 0.2 per cent that of the earth. A pair of smaller satellites, Nix and Hydra, was subsequently identified in 2005, with <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the final two of Pluto's known moons, named Kerberos and Styx, being discovered in 2011 and 2012 respectively</span>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>D: </strong>However, in spite of having been regarded as the ninth planet in the solar system for more than fifty years, Pluto's status and classification began to come into question towards the close of the twentieth century. Initially, this was due to the fact that during the nineties a number of objects, made of rock and ice and of a similar size to Pluto, were discovered lying within the Kuiper belt, a circumstellar disc, in many ways resembling a gigantic asteroid belt, at the edge of the Solar System beyond Neptune. The first of these new Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) was identified in 1992 by a pair of astronomers, David Jewitt and Jane Luu, working out of the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Many more Kuiper Belt Objects were found in the years that followed, making Pluto's official status as a planet increasingly controversial among many in the scientific community. While Pluto remains, at present, the largest of the known trans-Neptunian objects located in the Kuiper belt, the discovery in 2005 of a minor planet with a greater mass, Eris, in an outlying region of the Kuiper belt known as the scattered disc, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to create a formal definition of the term \"planet\" that excluded Pluto.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>E: </strong>When the New Horizons interplanetary space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral in January, 2006, its primary mission was to voyage to Pluto, at that time the only remaining unexplored planet in the Solar System. However, in August of the same year, at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) held in the Czech Republic, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet on account of the fact that it did not meet one of the three formal conditions required to be classed as a planet. According to the official definition of the IAU, a planet must be in orbit around the sun and have sufficient mass both for its own gravity to make it spherical in shape and <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">to have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects. Failing to meet the third of these criteria, Pluto was classified as a \"dwarf planet\"</span>. While the decision of the IAU to reduce the number of planets in the Solar System from nine to eight has received its fair share of both praise and criticism, the definition of Pluto as a dwarf planet, while controversial, remains in use. Today, there are five known bodies in the Solar System that have been recognised by the IAU as dwarf planets. In addition to Pluto, these are Ceres, Haumea, Makemake and Eris. At the same time, it has been estimated that there may be hundreds more as yet undiscovered and unclassified dwarf planets throughout the Solar System.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>F: </strong>The high resolution images of Pluto made during the New Horizons close flyby of the planet and beamed back to Earth from across the Solar System have revealed a unique terrain. Far from being a flat, dead world, the rocky dwarf planet's surface contains a multitude of varied, complex landscapes, ranging from oddly-textured ridges with the appearance of tree bark or dragon scales, ice cliffs, valleys and mountains and frozen lakes and oceans to heavily cratered and pitted plains. Experts theorise that, <span id=\"q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">in addition to the impact of other space bodies colliding with the planet, the majority of its terrain has been shaped by a combination of ice sublimation and tectonic forces</span>. While still awaiting official approval from the International Astronomical Union, names for a number of Pluto's regions and topographical features have already been proposed by the New Horizons discovery team in consultation with the general public, including Tombaugh Regio, the Brass Knuckles, Tartarus Dorsa and Cthulhu Regio, the latter named after a fictional deity from the works of American author H.P. Lovecraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>G: </strong>Irrespective of its official present classification as a dwarf planet, the New Horizons reconnaissance of Pluto provides a wealth of knowledge and data regarding the last major body in the Solar System not previously visited by a space probe. While the planet, spacecraft and New Horizons team may be comparatively small, the mission to the Pluto system not only represents the culmination of more than a decade's worth of preparation on Earth, but also the beginning of a new chapter in space exploration at the edge of the Solar System and beyond."
