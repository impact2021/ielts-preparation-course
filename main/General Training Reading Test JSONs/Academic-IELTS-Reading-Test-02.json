In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "content": "The Tempest: Shakespeare’s Final Play\r\n\r\nA: <span id=\"q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The 23rd of April, 2016, marked the four hundredth anniversary of the death of the world-renowned English playwright and poet, William Shakespeare</span>, at the age of 52. Numerous festivals, exhibitions, theatrical performances and other events were held around the world to commemorate the special anniversary year and celebrate and honour the life and continuing legacy of <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">a figure that many regard as being the world’s greatest dramatist</span>. In addition to the multitude of celebrations held in the author’s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, one of the more notable highlights across the Atlantic in the United States was the exhibition of Shakespeare’s First Folio, featuring discussion panels and a display of First Folio editions and digital content, in addition to local performances. The exhibition tour, its full title being First Folio: The Book That Gave Us Shakespeare, travelled to all fifty American states, as well as the country’s capital, Washington D.C., and the territory of Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nB: First published in 1623, seven years following Shakespeare’s death, the book known as the First Folio is widely regarded by scholars as being the first authentic print collection of all the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The content of the First Folio was prepared and compiled by Henry Condell and John Heminges</span>, two friends and colleagues of the playwright. <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Folio was published by the Stationers Company syndicate</span> under the title Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies. Of the estimated 750 copies of the First Folio that were originally printed, fewer than 250 survive today, each worth millions of dollars. The largest collection of First Folios is held by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., with a total of 82 copies. Among the 36 plays appearing in the pages of the First Folio are <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">eighteen of Shakespeare’s works that had never been previously published</span>, including Twelfth Night, Antony and Cleopatra, The Taming of the Shrew, Comedy of Errors, Macbeth and The Tempest.\r\n\r\nC: While there is not universal consensus, the overwhelming majority of contemporary Shakespeare critics consider The Tempest to have been the last of the plays penned by the bard. It is the first of Shakespeare’s works to appear in the contents of the First Folio, among his collected comedies. Today, The Tempest is regarded as one of Shakespeare’s greatest works. Perhaps due to the fact that it was the final play of his writing career as a playwright, more is known about the early performances of The Tempest than many of Shakespeare’s other dramatic works. <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">It was performed for the first time in Whitehall, London, on the 1st of November, 1611</span>, for an audience that included King James I. <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Another performance of the play was given at the royal court two years later</span>, forming part of the entertainment celebrating the marriage of the king’s daughter, Elizabeth, to Prince Frederick of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nD: As far as plot is concerned, The Tempest is set on a remote island where the deposed Duke of Milan, Prospero, and his daughter have been banished. Possessed of magical powers, Prospero conjures up a storm, or tempest, that causes a boat carrying a group of people from the mainland, including <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">his only brother – the treacherous Antonio – as well as King Alonso of Naples</span>, to become shipwrecked on the island. <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The play then moves through a number of scenes in five separate acts</span>, as the various characters interact. By the conclusion of the story, Prospero’s daughter, Miranda, and the son of King Alonso, Prince Ferdinand, have met and fallen in love and are married in Act IV of the play. At the same time, Prospero is redeemed and his former title and position are restored by the king as a result of revelations of his brother’s treachery. In the final scene, the epilogue of the play, Prospero, alone on the stage, addresses the audience in an extended monologue, renouncing his magical powers. With regard to this last scene, some early critics of Shakespeare’s work <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">viewed Prospero’s final speech in The Tempest as representing the author’s announcement to the audience of his own intention to retire from the playwright profession</span>.\r\n\r\nE: In terms of Shakespeare’s sources of inspiration for the writing of The Tempest, scholars have pointed out that each of the playwright’s dramatic works was very much influenced by popular topics and concerns of the day, and that the author would make use of existing written material, drawing on literature and other documents from a variety of sources for many of his ideas. The bard’s final play is no exception in this respect. Of particular note is a pamphlet that was published in England in 1610 under the title <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">A Discovery of the Bermudas, detailing the real-life account</span> of the shipwreck of English colonists</span> bound for Virginia in North America, which the playwright is known to have read. As well as funding the Virginia expedition, King James I had also written an essay on magic in 1603. <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The fact that the themes of colonialism and the supernatural both feature strongly in The Tempest</span> reflects that these topics were broadly popular in Shakespeare’s day when the play was written and performed. Experts have also pointed out that the author copied large parts of Prospero’s soliloquy at the end of the play from a speech made by the character Medea in the epic poem Metamorphoses, written by the Roman poet, Ovid.\r\n\r\nF: The fact that the 1623 First Folio publication of Shakespeare’s works opens with The Tempest is both a reflection of the play’s popularity at the time, as well as a significant factor in its subsequent critical history. Its position in first place certainly gave readers, academics and literary critics a strongly favourable impression of The Tempest in comparison with the author’s other works. Many felt, for example, that the bard’s final play represented the pinnacle of Shakespeare’s career, the playwright working at the height of his powers. In addition, the order of the works published in the First Folio lent greater weight to the idea that the character of the magician Prospero had been written by Shakespeare as a semi-autobiographical figure, intended to represent the genuine feelings of the author, at least at some level.\r\n\r\nG: Today, more than four centuries after The Tempest was written, it remains one of William Shakespeare’s most popular and widely-recognised works. As with his other plays, it has been translated into and published in dozens of languages. These dramatic works, with their well-drawn, complex characters and compelling storylines, have had a tremendous impact on the theatre, as well as the English language and culture. The bard’s swan song, The Tempest, <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">continues to be appreciated by modern audiences across the globe to this day in a variety of media formats, ranging from print publications of the original play and live theatrical performances to television and big screen adaptations</span>."
