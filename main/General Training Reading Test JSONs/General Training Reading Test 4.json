            "content": "Maritime Shipping's Heavy Fuel Oil Debate\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>In a world growing more and more concerned with pollution and the accompanying health issues, attention has turned to the heavy fuel oil (HFO) used by the world's shipping industry. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In a densely-populated port city such as Hong Kong, the shipping industry, from local tugs to ocean-going container and bulk cargo vessels, accounts for the largest amount of sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions</span> as well as the emission of particulate matter (PM), the mixture of minute particles and liquid droplets suspended in air. One estimate put forward is that <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">PM emissions contributed to 87,000 global premature deaths in 2012 and these large port cities like Hong Kong and Busan in Asia, Rotterdam and Antwerp in Europe and Los Angeles/Long Beach in the Americas have borne the brunt of the health issues</span> created by the growing volume of heavy emissions from the maritime industry.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>Globally, there are more than 90,000 vessels in the international marine fleet, handling over 90% of international trade. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Heavy fuel oil has been the mainstay of energy and propulsion requirements</span> through the second half of the 20th century as global trade has become the lifeblood of economic growth, but it is acknowledged that this same shipping now accounts for nearly 10% of the total emissions of SO2, which has been responsible for the environmentally devastating acid rain, and is a heavy contributor to respiratory problems and other illnesses in humans. In the United States alone, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 14,000 premature deaths annually owing to toxic emissions, and it is noted that the fuel used by ocean-plying vessels is 600 times dirtier than land transport diesel fuel.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>Once it was recognised that there was a strong causal relationship between pollutant emissions and health issues, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the International Maritime Organisation, or IMO, a UN agency that sets and regulates industry standards for safety and the environment, began formulating guidelines to determine and control safe standards for emissions</span>. Beginning in 2015, the IMO ruled that the first areas to be designated as Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, would be the Exclusive Economic Zones of North America and Northern Europe, where Marine Gas Oil with a permitted sulphur content of only 1,000 ppm (parts per million) would be allowed. <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>This was a dramatic proposal, as the then-current sulphur content of what are called bunker fuels ranged as high as 35,000 ppm. Further, from the year 2020, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the regulation is that all vessels sailing outside any ECA must cap their emissions at 5,000 ppm</span>.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span>But all this comes at a huge economic cost, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">not only for the commercial enterprises, but also the shipping companies and, by extension, their shippers, and the national economies of the countries involved</span>. As a result, much research has gone into determining the best approach to 'clean up', or even change, the fuel, and ultimately there seems to be two main approaches to comply with the requirements. Firstly, <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the oil industry would have to drop the sulphur content of the fuel from 3.5% to 0.5%</span>, which would achieve the required emissions levels, or <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">vessels would have to be fitted with what are known as 'scrubbers', technology that can clean the emissions</span>. However, it is recognised that the refining industry is not yet moving towards complying with the regulations regarding sulphur content, and as far as scrubbing is concerned, at an estimated US$4 million per engine fit out, the cost is often too high for many shipping countries.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span>In addition, along with other industries such as land transport and airline companies, much research is being conducted into looking at alternative fuels. For shipping, this revolves around investigating alternative sources such as Liquid (or Liquefied) Natural Gas, solar fuel cells, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">wind (an ironic twist on where shipping originally began)</span> and the controversial <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">nuclear energy, used in many naval fleets</span>. However, apart from the view that HFO is the cheapest alternative and that the merchant fleet is geared towards the continuing use of HFO, each alternative also presents some challenges. Natural gas takes up a large amount of storage on a vessel, thus reducing cargo-carrying capacity. Likewise, solar fuel cells, although effective, require huge amount of space and wind is not considered reliable enough. Nuclear energy remains a contentious issue, and many ports will restrict or deny entry to nuclear-powered vessels.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span>At the same time, the international shipping trade is experiencing a serious down-turn in profits. In 2007, the average daily revenue of a merchant vessel was US$34,000 but in 2017 that same figure was just US$9800, according to Clarkson Research, a global shipping consultancy firm. Part of this decline in profits is due to an excess of shipping vessels, but it also relates to the 2008 global financial crisis, and changes in the oil and export markets. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">All this means there will be a reluctance on the part of ship-owners, national state carriers and major shippers to contribute towards a scheme that, while benefiting the global environment and national health interests, sees little direct economic return.</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span>But the way forward is appearing. Gas-powered vessels are now operating, with its cleaner and more efficient fuel. Which, interestingly, has given rise to what is known as the \"fifth fuel\", that is energy efficiency. Because fuel traditionally accounts for up to half of all costs involved in shipping, there have always been innovative energy-saving approaches. One example is that <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">during the 2008 global crisis in finance and costs, sailing speeds on ocean vessels were reduced by oftentimes up to half, which resulted in massive fuel savings</span>. This has given rise to what is known as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, a compulsory outline of regulations that means that all new ships will be required to adhere to it from 2015.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Heavy Fuel Oil, however, will be the backbone of energy for the foreseeable future.</span> If engine scrubbers are deployed, and are as effective as engineered, they can capture more than 90% of exhaust sulphur and they will continue to be the main force in energy requirements. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Lloyds Registry, the industry classification organisation, believes that HFO will still make up nearly half of all fuels used in the maritime industry in 2030</span>, albeit with the agreed-upon restrictions set out.",
