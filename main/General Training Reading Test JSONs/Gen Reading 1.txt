<h3>ESITO dress code</h3>
The personal appearance of office workers and employees who have regular contact with the public is laid out in the company dress code. In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>
 	<li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>
 	<li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>
 	<li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>
 	<li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>
</ul>
The personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:
<ul>
 	<li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>
 	<li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>
 	<li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>
</ul>
Casual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.

Bad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.

The supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:

On the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department’s dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.

On the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.

<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>
<h4>Pension scheme</h4>
All employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an ‘opt out’ policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).
<h4>Medical insurance</h4>
Due to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.
<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>
All staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.
<h4>Communication</h4>
All members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.
<h4>Working from home</h4>
We are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager).
