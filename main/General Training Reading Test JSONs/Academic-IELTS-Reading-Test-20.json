In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "content": "Ancient Navigation Techniques\n\nLong before GPS satellites and electronic navigation systems, ancient seafarers developed sophisticated techniques to traverse vast ocean expanses, relying on careful observation of natural phenomena and accumulated knowledge passed through generations. <span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Polynesian navigators accomplished some of history's most remarkable maritime feats, settling islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean using traditional navigation methods that did not rely on written charts or instruments</span>. These navigation systems, preserved through oral tradition and practical apprenticeship, demonstrate humanity's capacity for innovation and adaptation in challenging environments.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Celestial navigation formed the foundation of ancient seafaring, with navigators using the sun, moon, planets, and stars to determine direction and latitude</span>. <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Polynesian navigators memorized the rising and setting positions of over 200 stars, creating a mental star map that showed them which way to go</span>. By observing which stars rose or set at particular points on the horizon, navigators could maintain course even when individual stars were obscured by clouds. The sun provided directional information during daylight, while certain stars passing directly overhead indicated specific latitudes, allowing navigators to sail along latitude lines to reach distant islands.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Wave and swell patterns provided crucial navigational information, particularly in the Pacific where consistent trade winds generate predictable ocean swells</span>. <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Experienced navigators could detect subtle variations in wave patterns caused by land masses, even when islands remained beyond the visible horizon</span>. Islands create distinctive wave interference patterns—waves bounce off islands, creating patterns that sailors can feel. By lying in the hull of an outrigger canoe and feeling these wave patterns through their bodies, navigators could detect land from distances exceeding 30 miles. <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Marshall Islanders created stick charts from coconut palm ribs and shells, with sticks representing wave patterns and shells indicating island positions, serving as teaching tools rather than carried navigational aids</span>.\n\nCloud formations offered additional clues to land proximity and direction. <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Clouds that stay in one place over islands because of warm air rising could be visible from great distances, while the color of cloud undersides reflected the terrain below—green tints indicating vegetation, lighter colors suggesting lagoons or coral reefs</span>. Navigators learned to distinguish between rain clouds and stationary clouds marking islands, using this information to adjust their course toward land.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span>Marine life provided navigational assistance in various ways. Certain seabird species, such as terns and noddies, travel significant distances from land to feed but return to roost on islands each evening. <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">By watching where these birds flew in late afternoon, navigators could find the direction to the nearest land even when islands were not visible</span>. Different bird species had characteristic ranges from land—some ventured only 20-30 miles from shore while others traveled up to 100 miles—allowing navigators to estimate distance to land based on which species they encountered. Fish behavior, floating debris, and even ocean color variations contributed to the navigator's comprehensive environmental awareness.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Norse navigators in the North Atlantic faced different challenges, developing techniques suited to their environment</span>. The Viking sun compass, a wooden disk with a stick in the middle that cast shadows throughout the day, allowed sailors to maintain course even on overcast days by observing the shadow's position at known times. <span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Some researchers suggest Vikings may have used \"sunstones\"—likely calcite crystals that polarize light, potentially allowing navigators to locate the sun's position even through clouds or fog</span>, though evidence remains debated.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Arab sailors developed the kamal, a simple but effective tool made of a wooden board attached to a string with knots, to measure how far north or south they were</span>. By holding the string between their teeth and positioning the board so its bottom edge aligned with the horizon and top edge with a known star, navigators could determine their latitude based on which knot was held. This allowed them to sail along specific latitudes across the Indian Ocean, reaching destinations from East Africa to Southeast Asia.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The decline of traditional navigation knowledge accelerated with European colonization and the introduction of Western navigation instruments, though recent decades have seen renewed efforts to preserve and revitalize traditional wayfinding practices</span>. Organizations like the Polynesian Voyaging Society have trained new generations of navigators using traditional techniques, demonstrating their continued viability while honoring ancestral knowledge systems. These efforts preserve not merely technical skills but entire cultural worldviews that emphasize deep connection with natural environment and sustainable relationships with ocean ecosystems."
