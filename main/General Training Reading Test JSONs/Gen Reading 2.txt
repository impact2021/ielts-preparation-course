Negotiating a Pay Rise

The passage discusses common mistakes in salary negotiations, including accepting offers too quickly, failing to research market value, revealing salary expectations too early, and taking negotiations personally. It also highlights the importance of flexibility, professionalism, and considering benefits other than salary.

A mistake equally common across all types of employee is the premature acceptance of the first offer for a pay rise.

Employees can become demoralised despite having a pay rise.

Many people are unsuccessful in salary discussions because of poor research.

It is important to clearly state what pay rise is expected at the beginning of the negotiation.

A negotiation could include a discussion of other benefits as well as salary.

You should avoid a pay negotiation when the employment market is not strong.
