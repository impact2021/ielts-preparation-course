In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, Poe was the second child of two professional actors. In the second year of his life, 1811, the young Poe, <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">his older brother Henry</span> and younger sister Rosalie, found themselves orphaned following the death of their mother from tuberculosis, the family having been abandoned by <span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Poe's father a year earlier</span>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1811, Poe was adopted by the Allan family of Richmond, Virginia. Mainly as a result of financial pressures, Poe's relationship with Frances and John Allan, his foster parents, was often tense. After completing secondary school, Poe attended the University of Virginia in 1826 at the age of seventeen. Despite excelling academically, notably in French and Latin, Poe quit university before completing his first year, after falling out with John Allan over the cost of his education and debts that he had accrued. In 1827 Poe moved to Boston and enlisted in the United States Army using a false name, <span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">publishing an anonymous collection of poetry entitled Tamerlane and Other Poems</span> in the same year.</p>\n\n<p>After two years of military service, during which time Poe rose to the rank of Sergeant Major, he was granted a discharge to enter the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet and further his education. During this time Poe clashed again with his foster father regarding financial support for his studies, and it is said that the young writer deliberately broke rules and neglected his duties while at West Point so that he would be dismissed. <span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In 1831, Poe was court-martialed for disobedience, afterwards moving to New York City for a brief period</span>. He had resolved to devote himself to his writing on a fulltime basis, publishing more poetry but having all of the short stories that he submitted to magazines rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of 1831, Poe left New York City and moved into the house of his aunt, Maria Clemm, in Baltimore, Maryland. He stayed in Baltimore for the best part of four years, writing and selling a number of both poems and short stories during this period. However, the young writer still struggled financially, in no small part as a result of the lack of international copyright laws at the time, meaning that the editors of literary magazines preferred to reprint British works rather than publish those of new American authors. One of the short stories that Poe wrote while living under his Aunt's roof, The Manuscript Found in a Bottle, won a magazine contest, helping him to secure a position as editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in 1835.</p>\n\n<p>As editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond, Virginia, Poe was instrumental in lifting the publication's readership, raising circulation from fewer than 1000 to 3500 copies. During this time, Poe established his reputation as a literary critic and began to focus on writing prose, rather than poetry. He quit the paper in <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">1836</span>, however, citing the <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">low salary</span> and lack of editorial control as the primary reasons. In the same <span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">year, Poe married</span> a woman many years his junior, before returning to New York in 1837. Over the following decade, the writer held a number of editorial positions with various leading literary journals of the day in both <span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">New York and Philadelphia, including the Broadway Journal, Burton's Gentleman's Magazine and Graham's Magazine</span>.</p>\n\n<p>The year 1839 saw the publication of Poe's first volume of short stories, Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque, although he received no payment for the work, and supplemented his income from editing jobs by giving lectures and public readings. Continuing to write in different forms throughout this period of his life and career, in 1841 the author published what is generally considered to be the first story in the genre of detective fiction, entitled The Murders in the Rue Morgue. The following year, Poe quit his editing job with Graham's Magazine, planning to start his own publication, Stylus. Unfortunately, this venture was not successful. Poe attained further literary recognition in 1843, however, winning first prize in a competition for his story The Gold Bug, a tale heavily influenced by his interest in cryptography.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of winning one hundred dollars in prize money for The Gold Bug, Poe was still struggling to support his family financially. However, in 1845 the publication of his poem <span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Raven</span>, arguably the author's single most widely recognized work, won him lasting fame. <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Poe became an almost overnight literary sensation in his home country, and The Raven played a significant role in securing his international reputation as a writer</span>. The poem explores a number of the gothic themes common to Poe's writing, including those of love, beauty, death and loss. While he was now a household name in the country of his birth, Poe continued to have difficulty in making ends meet, and was overcome by grief and sorrow following the death of his wife, Virginia, from tuberculosis in 1847.</p>\n\n<p>After the loss of his wife, it is said that Poe's behaviour became more erratic, and that his lifelong battle with depression worsened. He left the Bronx, in New York, where he and Virginia had been living and stayed in Rhode Island for a brief period, before returning to Richmond. The precise details surrounding Poe's death and his final days are a matter of considerable debate. It has been reported that the author left Richmond by train on September 27, 1849, supposedly with the intention of travelling to Philadelphia for an editing job. However, for reasons unknown, Poe ended up in Baltimore, where he was found in the street on October 3, semiconscious and in a state of delirium. He was taken to the Washington Medical College and died four days later, on October 7, 1849.</p>\n\n<p>While he was alive, <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Edgar Allan Poe was most widely recognized in the country of his birth as a literary critic and editor. At the same time, he was known as both a fiction writer and poet</span>, and one of the first nineteenth century American authors to attain greater popularity in Europe than in the United States. Today, Poe is one of America's most enduring writers, as well as being among the first to become a major figure in world literature. He is considered to be the originator of <span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">gothic fiction</span>, as well as being a contributor to the development of science fiction and the modern short story form. The works of Edgar Allan Poe have inspired and influenced a host of other notable artists, writers and film directors, the likes of Salvador Dali, Charles Baudelaire and Alfred Hitchcock, to name but a few.</p>"
