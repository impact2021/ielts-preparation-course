The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. <span id=\"passage-q22\" data-question=\"22\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years.</span> Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\r\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\r\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. <span id=\"passage-q23\" data-question=\"23\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.</span>\r\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\r\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. <span id=\"passage-q24\" data-question=\"24\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before</span> the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\r\n<h4>Communication</h4>\r\n<span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">All members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment.</span> This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\r\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\r\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. <span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful</span> and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "content": "THE NON-MILITARY USES OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES\r\n\r\nA) The use of unmanned aerial vehicles has grown dramatically over the past decade or so, in no small part due to the fact that some of these machines are able to remain airborne for longer periods of time than more conventional manned aircraft. At the same time, <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), and remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs), nowadays commonly referred to as drones, are generally credited with being both more cost-effective to operate and maintain, as well as safer to use, than piloted aircraft.</span> The term drone may also refer to small electric helicopters fitted with two or more rotors which are flown by remote control.\r\n\r\nB) Today, drones are being used with increasing frequency for military operations by a number of countries in combat, surveillance and reconnaissance roles. These machines tend to be larger than non-military drones and are, in the main, powered by jet or gas engines. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the use of drone technology has gained a measure of notoriety as a result of their growing prominence in military roles, which have been widely publicised in television, online and print media during the last decade and a half, leading to criticism of their application in this arena on both ethical and legal grounds.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span>C) While originally and currently still primarily used for military purposes, the rapid growth and development in drone technology during the early twenty-first century has led some experts to predict that, by 2030, there will be approximately 30,000 licensed drones operating in the skies above the United States alone. It has also been estimated that the economic value of the commercial drone market will rise in value to around $90 billion globally during the next five years, <span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">as well as create as many as 150,000 new jobs by 2035.</span> <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">A projection by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimates that agricultural applications will one day account for approximately 80 percent of commercial drone use.</span>\r\n\r\nD) One development related to the commercial use of drones which has perhaps received the greatest amount of news and media coverage in recent years is the establishment of Amazon Prime Air in the early 2020s by the US-based online retail giant, Amazon.com. <span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Amazon Prime Air's drone-based delivery system for its customers' purchases is now operational, though it's still growing and faces regulatory considerations. Deliveries occur during daylight hours and in good weather conditions</span>, although the company has been granted permission by the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to begin testing its current prototypes under certain restrictions.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>E) As far as aerial filming and photography are concerned, commercial drones have a number of applications in industries ranging from those of movie production and the news media, to real estate, telecommunications and security. More specific uses in these fields include, though are by no means limited to, taking promotional photos and videos for commercial and residential properties on the market, filming breaking-news stories and live sports events, producing footage from unique perspectives for movies and carrying out security and surveillance functions in the detection of criminal activity and identification of criminals.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>F) In addition to the delivery of consumer products and other commercial applications, non-military drones are gaining popularity for use in search and rescue operations. <span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Drone-mounted cameras enable unmanned aerial vehicles to follow pre-programmed search patterns when looking for missing persons and victims of natural disasters across a variety of otherwise inaccessible terrain types, including marine environments.</span> With the addition of infrared thermal imaging camera technology, drones can also carry out search and rescue missions after dark, with much greater manoeuvrability and at less cost than using a helicopter, for example.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span>G) These days, drones are increasingly being used by national government agencies and local authorities for a variety of purposes outside of the private sector. Transport agencies, both road and rail, make use of unmanned aerial vehicles for monitoring traffic flow and reporting accidents and hazards, while civil planners utilise the technology to assist with mapping and surveying work. Fire departments in some jurisdictions now rely on UAVs to help them reduce risks and costs when fighting fires in both urban and rural areas, while customs and law enforcement agencies also employ drone technology in protecting citizens and borders through monitoring and surveillance.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>H) In terms of the natural world, scientists and researchers are turning to drones with greater frequency to monitor, document and assess changes in the health, movement and distribution of flora and fauna, as well as pollution, weather and the climate, both conveniently and cost-effectively. Unmanned aircraft are today being used not only in environmental and ecological research, but also as cutting-edge tools to assist in wildlife conservation efforts. In the latter capacity, drone technology is now being used by both governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations in the surveillance and prevention of illegal hunting and poaching of a number of endangered species.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>I) While advocates of drones are quick to point out all of the many benefits that the machines can bring to society and the planet, the technology is not without its critics. Those opposed to the growing use of unmanned aerial vehicles cite a number of negative aspects related to the seemingly inexorable rise of drones and their myriad possible applications in our lives. <span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">These include logistical concerns such as the comparatively short flight times of smaller UAVs (presently between 30 and 45 minutes) and their operational limitations in terms of spatial mobility. Other perceived disadvantages are safety risks, in the potential for collisions across increasingly crowded airspace</span>, <span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">and even the adverse effects drones may have on the natural environment, particularly as contributors to noise pollution.</span>\r\n\r\nJ) Whether for commercial or recreational applications or being used as tools to assist those working in the public sector, it would appear that the numerical proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as their numerous potential uses, means that the impact of drone technology in our lives is only set to increase. While there are undoubtedly issues yet to be resolved regarding the use of drones, particularly in relation to regulatory oversight and legal restrictions on the part of relevant authorities, the futuristic technology afforded us in the form of these robotic vehicles indicates that not the sky, but rather the solar system and beyond, may be the limit."
