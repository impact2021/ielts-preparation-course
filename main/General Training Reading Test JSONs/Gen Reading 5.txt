Dressed for Work

Choosing what to wear at work can be difficult, particularly when starting a new job. Dressing too casually may give the impression that you are not taking your role seriously, while dressing too formally can make colleagues think you are unapproachable.

If possible, check the dress code after being offered a position. When attending interviews, observe what other employees are wearing.

For men, dark trousers, shoes and a simple shirt are generally acceptable. Wearing a tie on the first day is fine, but it may be unnecessary if no one else is wearing one.

For women, expectations vary widely, so observing colleagues in similar roles is often the best guide.

In many countries, especially in large corporations, there has been a move towards stricter dress codes, including uniforms for management.

Additional advice includes choosing conservative colours, avoiding large jewellery, maintaining good hygiene, and avoiding clothing with obvious designer logos.

Questions 11–14

[This is an open question set.
Question type: Short answer.
There are 4 questions (11–14).
Answers must use NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER.]

During what should you start looking at the dress code employees seem to be following?

What might men want to think about wearing or not wearing on the second day?

Apart from being in the same office, what makes a colleague a useful guide for what to wear?

What type of company is introducing management uniforms?

Salary Negotiation and Workplace Development

Successful salary negotiations require preparation. Many employees accept the first offer without researching what others in similar roles earn.

Negotiations should not focus solely on salary. Other benefits such as flexible hours or additional leave may also be discussed.

It is important not to take rejection personally. If negotiations fail, remain professional and move on gracefully, as maintaining positive relationships is essential and you never want to burn bridges.

Questions 15–20

[This is a closed question set.
Question type: TRUE / FALSE / NOT GIVEN.
There are 6 questions (15–20).
Answer options must be displayed as: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN.]

A mistake equally common across all types of employee is the premature acceptance of the first salary offer.

Employees can become demoralised despite receiving a pay rise.

Many people are unsuccessful in salary negotiations because of poor research.

It is important to clearly state the expected pay rise at the beginning of negotiations.

A negotiation could include discussion of benefits other than salary.

You should avoid salary negotiations when the employment market is weak.

Training and development programmes are usually created after weaknesses are identified.

Staff training always leads directly to promotion.

Companies prefer to recruit new employees rather than train existing staff.

Staff morale may improve as a result of training.

Customer service training is often overlooked.

Training employees to work with people from different cultural backgrounds benefits organisations more than many realise.

Employees should avoid maintaining contact with employers after unsuccessful negotiations.
