In brief, the code requires all employees to observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Clean, pressed, properly fitting business casual attire is appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Hair should be clean, combed and neatly arranged. Long hair is acceptable if it is tied back.</li>\n  <li>Moustaches and beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>\n  <li>Good personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>\n  <li>Use perfume or cologne in small quantities or not at all (some people are allergic to various scents).</li>\n</ul>\nThe personal appearance of employees who do not regularly meet the public is to be decided by the requirements of safety, comfort and supervisor approval. Even so, because all employees are a representative of the company, they should be as neat and business-like as working conditions permit. The following are some examples of inappropriate dress at all times:\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded and/or tattered/torn jeans; t-shirts displaying advertising or writing</li>\n  <li>Faded overalls, cotton/fleece pants and jogging suits, shorts, tank tops or recreational attire</li>\n  <li>Clothing revealing bare backs, midriffs or shoulders; or any revealing clothing.</li>\n</ul>\nCasual Fridays: The Company has designated Fridays as casual days. Some clothing is still considered inappropriate even on casual days. Employees are requested to use good sense in this regard.\n\nBad weather days: The Company understands that inclement weather conditions can require different attire for the day. Use good judgment when dressing for weather conditions. NOTE: This only impacts on employees working in the yard.\n\nThe supervisor is responsible for evaluating the dress and appearance of employees under his or her supervision. If an employee is not dressed appropriately, the supervisor should take the following steps:\n\nOn the first occasion, a documented verbal warning should be given to the employee, and the department's dress and appearance standards should be reviewed. If the supervisor deems it necessary, the employee may be sent home to change into appropriate clothing.\n\nOn the second occasion, the employee must be sent home to change clothes immediately as well as given a written warning. Further violations may result in discipline up to and including discharge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Benefits and amendment to benefits for Glyph Interactive employees</h4>\n<h4>Pension scheme</h4>\nAll employees are automatically included in our pension scheme, although there is an 'opt out' policy for employees with private pension plans. The pension scheme is no longer non-contributory, with employees now being asked to pay 25% of the annual payment. Government contributions will amount to an additional 25%, with Glyph Interactive continuing to support employees by covering the remaining 50%. Employees need to pay into the pension scheme for a minimum of 20 years. Once an employee reaches the age of 65, the pension payments begin. Employees who do not reach the twenty year mark will be paid pro rata (that is, an employee who has worked only ten years will receive only 50% of that received by an employee with twenty years experience).\n<h4>Medical insurance</h4>\nDue to rising costs, we can no longer support offering medical insurance to retiring employees. Standard cover still applies to all active employees, with one important addition. The immediate family (spouse and children) of the employee can also be covered for the same benefits and services. This will attract an additional payment depending on the current health of those wishing to be covered, but will be well below the cost of seeking insurance with a private company.\n<h4>Access to company vehicles</h4>\nAll staff with a legitimate need to travel will have access to one of the company vehicles. Please note that this is to be used for company purposes only, and must be applied for in writing at least two days before the vehicle is needed. For urgent and unexpected requirements, please consult your manager. The only exception to this is for sales staff, who have already been issued their own vehicles.\n<h4>Communication</h4>\nAll members of staff have a laptop which is issued on the first day of employment. This will now be supplemented by the addition of a Smartphone. Please note, however, that all calls and communications using the Smartphone should be for company purposes only unless in an emergency. Training events will be posted in the next few weeks to help you get to grips with the new phone.\n<h4>Working from home</h4>\nWe are now in the second year of the trial of some employees working from home for at least a part of the week. Despite some earlier difficulties, the scheme has proven successful and will now be offered as an option for all staff (although final approval must be given by your manager)."

            "title": "The Global Water Crisis and Innovative Solutions",
            "content": "Paragraph A: Water scarcity represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Although water covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface, only 2.5% is freshwater, and just 1% of that is readily accessible for human use—the rest is locked in glaciers and ice caps. Currently, more than 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and the United Nations projects that by 2050, up to 5.7 billion people could be living in areas where water is scarce for at least one month per year. This crisis is driven by multiple interconnected factors: population growth, urbanization, industrial development, agricultural expansion, and climate change. The problem is not merely one of physical scarcity but also of economic scarcity, where communities lack the infrastructure to access available water resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph B: Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, making it the largest consumer of water resources worldwide. Traditional irrigation methods are notoriously inefficient, with up to 60% of water lost through evaporation, runoff, or by watering areas that don't require irrigation. In many developing countries, farmers still rely on flood irrigation, where entire fields are submerged, resulting in massive water waste. The production of different foods requires vastly different amounts of water—known as 'virtual water' content. For instance, producing one kilogram of beef requires approximately 15,000 liters of water when accounting for the water needed to grow feed crops, while one kilogram of wheat requires about 1,500 liters. As global meat consumption rises with increasing affluence, the water footprint of food production grows proportionally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph C: Innovative agricultural technologies are emerging to address water inefficiency. Drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to plant roots through a network of tubes, can reduce water use by 30-50% compared to traditional methods while actually increasing crop yields. Israeli farmers, facing severe water scarcity, pioneered many of these technologies and now achieve remarkable productivity with minimal water use. Precision agriculture uses sensors, GPS technology, and data analytics to optimize water application, ensuring crops receive exactly the amount of water they need, when they need it. Some farmers are even using drones equipped with multispectral cameras to identify areas of crop stress before they're visible to the human eye, allowing for targeted irrigation. Drought-resistant crop varieties developed through both traditional breeding and genetic modification offer another avenue, potentially reducing agricultural water requirements by 20-40% for certain crops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph D: Urban water systems face distinct challenges, particularly in rapidly growing cities in developing countries where infrastructure cannot keep pace with population growth. Water loss through leaking pipes—known as non-revenue water—is staggering, with some cities losing 40-60% of their water supply before it reaches consumers. In many urban areas, especially informal settlements, residents lack access to piped water and must purchase water from vendors at prices 10-20 times higher than what connected households pay. Smart water meters and sensor networks can help cities detect leaks quickly and monitor consumption patterns, potentially reducing water loss significantly. Singapore, facing severe water scarcity due to its small size and lack of natural water sources, has become a global leader in water management through a combination of technological innovation, strict regulations, and public education.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph E: Desalination—the process of removing salt from seawater—represents a promising but energy-intensive solution to water scarcity. Currently, over 16,000 desalination plants operate worldwide, primarily in water-scarce regions like the Middle East, producing about 95 million cubic meters of freshwater daily. Traditional desalination methods require a lot of energy, making them expensive and environmentally concerning. However, technology is improving efficiency. New membranes can reduce energy use by up to 40%, and some facilities are using renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, to reduce environmental impact. Researchers are also exploring new membranes inspired by how mangrove trees and other salt-tolerant plants filter water, which could make desalination much more efficient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph F: Water recycling and reuse, once considered taboo in many cultures, is gaining acceptance as technology advances. Modern wastewater treatment can produce water that meets or exceeds drinking water standards, though psychological barriers to 'toilet-to-tap' systems remain strong in many communities. Singapore's NEWater program successfully overcame this resistance through transparent communication, public education, and high-profile endorsements. The reclaimed water, which undergoes microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet disinfection, now meets up to 40% of Singapore's water needs and is used in both industrial applications and, blended with reservoir water, for drinking. In California, Orange County operates the world's largest water purification system for indirect potable reuse, producing enough water for 850,000 people. Greywater systems, which recycle water from sinks, showers, and washing machines for use in toilet flushing and irrigation, are becoming more common in both residential and commercial buildings, potentially reducing household water consumption by 30%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph G: Atmospheric water harvesting, while still in early development, offers an innovative approach to water generation. This technology captures water vapor from the air through various methods. A team at MIT developed a solar-powered device using specialized materials (metal-organic frameworks or MOFs) that can pull water from air with humidity as low as 20%, potentially providing water for remote or disaster-affected areas. Fog harvesting, practiced in some coastal regions of Chile, Peru, and Morocco, uses large mesh nets to capture water droplets from fog, providing extra water for communities where traditional water sources are limited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph H: Addressing the global water crisis will require a multifaceted approach combining technological innovation, policy reform, behavior change, and significant investment in infrastructure. Water pricing reform, while politically sensitive, could incentivize conservation by ensuring prices reflect water's true value and scarcity. Currently, many agricultural and domestic water users pay heavily subsidized rates that encourage wasteful consumption. Strengthening water governance and management institutions is crucial, particularly for transboundary water resources where cooperation between nations is essential. Education and awareness campaigns can shift behaviors, reducing per capita water consumption. Most importantly, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies must be integrated into water resource planning, as changing precipitation patterns and increased drought frequency will fundamentally alter water availability in many regions. The solutions exist, but implementing them at the necessary scale requires political will, financial resources, and global cooperation. The question is not whether we can solve the water crisis, but whether we will act quickly enough to prevent catastrophic shortages that could trigger conflict, mass migration, and humanitarian disasters."
