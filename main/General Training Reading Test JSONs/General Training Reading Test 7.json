This ensures your request is realistic and backed by data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q16\" data-question=\"16\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Document your achievements and contributions over the past year, including successful projects, additional responsibilities you have assumed, and positive feedback from colleagues or clients</span>. This evidence strengthens your case considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose an appropriate time to request a meeting—ideally after a successful project completion, during performance reviews, or when the company is performing well financially.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Negotiation Meeting</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q17\" data-question=\"17\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Start the conversation by thanking your manager for considering your request and expressing your commitment to the organization</span>. This sets a positive tone for the discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q18\" data-question=\"18\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Present your case clearly by explaining why you deserve a raise, focusing on the value you bring to the company rather than personal financial needs</span>. Mention specific accomplishments and how you have improved efficiency or contributed to company goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen carefully to your manager's feedback. They may outline concerns, budget constraints, or offer alternative benefits such as additional vacation days or flexible working arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>After the Discussion</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q19\" data-question=\"19\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">If your manager needs time to consider, request a follow-up meeting within two weeks to discuss their decision</span>. Agree on a specific date before the meeting concludes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q20\" data-question=\"20\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Even if your initial request is declined, ask what specific improvements or achievements would make you eligible for a raise in the future, and establish clear goals to work towards</span>. This demonstrates your commitment to professional growth and keeps the door open for future negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that negotiation is a normal business practice, and most employers expect employees to request pay increases periodically.</p>"

This shows that you have tailored your application to this particular opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"passage-q24\" data-question=\"24\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In the main body, explain why you are interested in the company and the role, highlighting how your skills and experience match the job requirements</span>.

            "content": "A: In [Q32][Q33]the late 1970s, people in northern Europe were observing a change in the lakes and forests around them. Areas once famous for the quality and quantity of their fish began to decline, and areas of once-green forest were dying. The phenomenon they witnessed was acid rain – pollutants in rain, snow,<span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span> hail and fog caused by [Q34]sulphuric and nitric acids.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB: [Q26]The principal chemicals that cause these acids are sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, both by-products of burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas). A percentage of acid rain is natural, from volcanoes, forest fires and biologica<span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>l decay, but the majority is unsurprisingly manmade. Of this, [Q35]transportation sources account for 40%; power plants 30%; industrial sources 25%; and commercial institutions and residues 5%. What makes these figures particularly disturbing is that since the 1970s, nitrogen oxide emissions have tripled. Each y<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>ear the global atmosphere is polluted with 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 130 million tons of sulphur dioxide, more than three million tons of toxic metals, and a wealth of synthetic organic compounds, many of which are proven causes of cancer, genetic mutations and birth defects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC: [Q27]For <span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span>natural causes of acid rain, nature has provided a filter. Naturally occurring substances such as limestone or other antacids can neutralise this acid rain before it enters the water cycle, thereby protecting it. However, areas with a predominantly quartzite- or granite-based geology and little top soil have no <span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>such effect, and the basic environment shifts from an alkaline to an acidic one. Recycled and intensified through the water table, acid rain has reached such a degree in some parts of the world that rainfall is now 40 times more acidic than normal – the same acidic classification as vinegar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD: [Q<span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>28]Environmentally, the impact is devastating. Lakes and the life they support are dying, unable to withstand such a battering. This has a direct effect on the animals that rely on [Q36]fish as a food source. Certain species of American otter have had their numbers reduced by over half in the last 20 years, for <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span>example. Yet this is not the only effect. Nitrogen oxides, the principal reagent in acid rain, react with other pollutants to produce ozone, a major air pollutant responsible for destroying the effectiveness of farmland, making it significantly [Q37]less productive. With scientists working on producing ever bigg<span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span>er and longer lasting genetically modified foods, some farmers are reporting abnormally low yields. Tomatoes grow to only half their full weight and the leaves, stalks and roots of other crops never reach full maturity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE: [Q29]Naturally it rains on cities too, eating away stone monuments and conc<span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span>rete structures, and corroding the pipes which channel the water away to the lakes where the cycle is repeated. Paint exposed to rain is not lasting as long due to the pollution in the atmosphere speeding up the corrosion process. In some communities the drinking water is laced with [Q38]toxic metals freed from <span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span>metal pipes by the acidity. After any period of non-use, we are encouraged to run taps for at least 60 seconds to flush any excess debris, as increased concentrations of metals in plumbing such as lead, copper and zinc result in adverse health effects. As if urban skies were not already grey enough, typical visi<span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span>bility has declined from ten to four miles, in many American cities, as acid rain turns into smog. Also, now there are indicators that the components of acid rain are a health risk, linked to human respiratory disease.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nF: [Q30]Acid rain itself is not an entirely new phenomenon. In the nineteenth c<span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span>entury, acid rain fell both in towns and cities. What is new, and of great concern, is that it can be transported thousands of kilometres due to the introduction of [Q39]tall chimneys dispersing pollutants high into the atmosphere, allowing strong wind currents to blow the acid rain hundreds of miles from its so<span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span>urce. Thus the areas where acid rain falls are not necessarily the areas where the pollution comes from. Pollution from industrial areas of England are damaging forests in Scotland and Scandinavia. Acids from the Midwest United States are blown into northwest Canada. More and more regions are beginning to be aff<span id=\"passage-q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span>ected, and given that 13 of the world's most polluted cities are in neighbouring Asia, countries like Australia and New Zealand are increasingly under threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nG: [Q31][Q40]Transboundary pollution, the spread of acid rain across political and international borders, has prompted a number of internat<span id=\"passage-q41\" data-question=\"41\"></span>ional responses. International legislation during the 1980s and 1990s has led to reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions in many countries but reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides have been much less, leading to the conclusion that without a cooperative global effort, the problem of acid rain will not simply blow away.",
