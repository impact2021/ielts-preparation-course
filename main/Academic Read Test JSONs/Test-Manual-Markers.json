For example, [Q1]manual markers work perfectly in reading passages just like they do in listening transcripts. This is very convenient.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use the manual HTML format for more control. For instance, <span id=\"q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the system highlights the correct text when you click the show button</span> which helps students find answers quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Both methods are now fully supported and work seamlessly with the \"Show in the reading passage\" button.</p>"
