Some of the more famous trophies are the World Cup for football, held every four years, which was inaugurated in 1930 in Uruguay, and won for the first time by the host nation. <span id=\"passage-q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Rugby union also holds a quadrennial World Cup</span>, and the trophy is called the Webb-Ellis Trophy, which has been held aloft by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa each twice, and by England once. The symbol of supremacy in American football, called 'gridiron', is the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers, while the Ryder Cup is given to one of two golfing teams, the United States or the European team, that emerges victorious in their biennial competition. Individually, the Green Jacket is awarded to the winner of the Masters Golf tournament while the Claret Jug is presented to the British Open Golf champion. Another famous variation on a trophy is the Yellow Jersey, taken by the winner of each stage in the famous Tour de France cycle race, and to the overall victor. Horse racing has its famous Melbourne Cup and tennis the Davis Cup, while sailing has the America's Cup and the Admiral's Cup. The list is endless, with each sport having its competitors striving relentlessly to emerge the champion, and to lay claim to the sporting prize, the trophy, the cup or the <span id=\"passage-q7\" data-question=\"7\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">winning apparel</span>. The storied history of the Stanley Cup, the oldest professional North American sports trophy, presented to the winner of the National Hockey League's ice hockey champions, is long, and fabled.</p>\n\n<p>Frederick Arthur Stanley, Lord Stanley of Preston, Earl of Derby, was born in London, England, in 1841, and established a career as a Conservative Party politician. In 1888, he was <span id=\"passage-q8\" data-question=\"8\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">nominated by Queen Victoria as the Governor-General of Canada</span>, a position he served until 1893. In his first year on arriving in Canada, Lord Stanley, an avid sports fan, attended the Montreal Winter Carnival which featured an ice hockey match between the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, won by the Victorias in a close contest, 2-1. It was reported that Lord Stanley was impressed with the skill of the players and thoroughly enjoyed the game. <span id=\"passage-q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Three of his sons went on to play for the Ottawa Rebels team</span> and Lord Stanley took a particular interest in promoting the sport of ice hockey. One way that he felt that more interest could be generated would be if there was a trophy that could be competed for by all teams in Canada. In 1892, <span id=\"passage-q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Lord Stanley advised the Amateur Athletic Association that because there was not an organized championship, and with a bid to standardize the rules of ice hockey, he would donate a trophy which would be competed for across the Dominion of the then-young Canada, and his proposal was accepted by the sports foundations throughout the country</span>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1893, Lord Stanley purchased a silver punch bowl, approximately 18 cms high and 25 cms wide, for ten guineas, which was equal to $50.00, and had the words \"From Stanley of Preston\" engraved on the side. He set a series of rules for the competition of his Cup, the main one being that the winning team would hold the Cup for one year, and then return it to be competed for again in an annual nation-wide series of competitions. <span id=\"passage-q11-13\" data-question=\"11\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In the early years, the Cup was mainly contested by teams in the eastern part of Canada, with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association being the first champions in 1893</span>. In 1915, an understanding was reached between the National Hockey Association in the east of Canada and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in the west whereby the respective winners of these leagues would meet to compete for the Cup. Over the years, the face of hockey changed in Canada, with more teams being added, and <span id=\"passage-q9\" data-question=\"9\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">professionalism making its mark</span>. The National Hockey League, or NHL, became the predominant sporting organization for professional hockey, and in 1926 the Stanley Cup became the symbol of the championship of the NHL season, and <span id=\"passage-q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">to this day the Cup is competed for by the 30 teams from Canada and the United States in the NHL</span>. One feature of the Stanley Cup is that it <span id=\"passage-q10\" data-question=\"10\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">has grown in size, with new silver rings being added</span>, as the names of the players on the winning team are engraved onto the trophy.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps unique among major sporting trophies, the Stanley Cup has a long and sometimes infamous history, including being lost, thrown in a river, stolen, and being used as a popcorn holder. In 1907, a photographer was given the Cup as he was documenting the winning team's victorious season, and while the Cup was at his home, his mother, unsure of what to make of it, filled it with soil and turned it into a flower-pot. Another story is recounted of the winner of the Kentucky Derby, a famous American horse race, named 'Go For Gin', who ate oats from the Cup. Or, in recent times, when the Cup spent the night at the bottom of one of the winning team's player's swimming pool, because <span id=\"passage-q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">tradition dictates that each player from the winning team gets to personally keep the Cup for one day, provided it is looked after and returned in pristine condition</span>, a rule often not always adhered to. Which is why the NHL has now hired security guards to administer and look after the Stanley Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Stanley of Preston would surely now look upon his famous trophy with a sense of both wonderment and bewilderment. The Stanley Cup is fought for and prized by both players and fans alike, and the ultimate reward in professional hockey is to be a player on the winning team skating around the arena with the Stanley Cup held high for the fans, and players themselves, to see and cherish.</p>"
