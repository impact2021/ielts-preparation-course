            "content": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has fundamentally transformed the technological landscape of the 21st century. <span id=\"passage-q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Unlike traditional programming, where computers follow explicitly programmed instructions, machine learning algorithms can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for each specific task</span>. This paradigm shift has enabled computers to tackle complex problems that were previously thought to require human intelligence.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q7\" data-question=\"7\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can access data and use it to learn for themselves</span>. The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples provided. <span id=\"passage-q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance</span> and adjust actions accordingly.\n\nThere are three main types of machine learning approaches. <span id=\"passage-q8\" data-question=\"8\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Supervised learning involves training algorithms on labeled datasets, where the desired output is already known</span>. The algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors and modify the model accordingly. This method is commonly used for classification tasks such as email spam detection or medical diagnosis. Unsupervised learning, by contrast, deals with unlabeled data, where the system tries to learn without a teacher. The algorithm must find structure in the input on its own by extracting useful features and analyzing its structure. <span id=\"passage-q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Clustering and association are two types of unsupervised learning problems</span>. The third approach, reinforcement learning, involves an agent that learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results, receiving rewards or penalties.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q9\" data-question=\"9\"></span>The applications of machine learning are vast and continue to expand rapidly. In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images to detect diseases such as cancer at earlier stages than traditional methods. <span id=\"passage-q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Financial institutions employ machine learning for fraud detection systems that can identify suspicious transactions in real-time</span>. The retail industry uses ML for personalized product recommendations, while autonomous vehicles rely on machine learning to navigate roads safely. Natural language processing, a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language, powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.\n\nHowever, the rise of AI and machine learning also presents significant challenges. <span id=\"passage-q10\" data-question=\"10\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">One major concern is algorithmic bias, which occurs when machine learning systems reflect the implicit values of the humans who create or train them</span>. If training data contains biases, the resulting model will likely perpetuate or even amplify these biases. For instance, facial recognition systems have been shown to have higher error rates for people of color, largely because the training datasets were not sufficiently diverse. <span id=\"passage-q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Privacy concerns have emerged as ML systems require vast amounts of personal data to function effectively</span>.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q11\" data-question=\"11\"></span>Another challenge is the \"black box\" problem. Many machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, are so complex that even their creators cannot fully explain how they arrive at specific decisions. This lack of transparency raises concerns in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis or criminal justice, where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is crucial. <span id=\"passage-q6\" data-question=\"6\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Researchers are developing explainable AI systems that can provide human-understandable explanations for their decisions</span>.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q12\" data-question=\"12\"></span>Looking ahead, the future of AI and machine learning appears promising yet uncertain. <span id=\"passage-q13\" data-question=\"13\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Experts predict that the integration of AI with other emerging technologies such as quantum computing and 5G networks will unlock new possibilities</span>. Quantum machine learning could solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers, while 5G will enable real-time AI applications at scale. However, realizing this potential will require addressing current limitations in computational power, data quality, and ethical frameworks. The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—machines with human-level intelligence across all domains—remains a distant goal, with experts disagreeing on whether and when it might be achieved."

            "content": "Sustainable Urban Development\n\n<span id=\"passage-q14\" data-question=\"14\"></span>As the global population continues to urbanize at an unprecedented rate, with the United Nations projecting that 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050, the concept of sustainable urban development has become increasingly critical. <span id=\"passage-q20\" data-question=\"20\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Urban sustainability involves creating cities that meet the needs of present residents without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</span>. This encompasses environmental, economic, and social dimensions, requiring integrated approaches to urban planning and management.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q15\" data-question=\"15\"></span>The environmental challenges facing modern cities are substantial. Urban areas account for approximately 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, despite occupying only 3% of the Earth's land surface. <span id=\"passage-q21\" data-question=\"21\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Cities consume two-thirds of the world's energy and produce more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions</span>. The concentration of buildings, transportation systems, and industrial activities creates urban heat islands, where temperatures can be several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Additionally, cities face challenges related to air and water pollution, waste management, and loss of green spaces. <span id=\"passage-q16\" data-question=\"16\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The World Health Organization estimates that 9 out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air, with urban residents particularly affected</span>.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q17\" data-question=\"17\"></span>To address these challenges, cities around the world are implementing innovative sustainable development strategies. Green building practices have gained prominence, with structures designed to minimize environmental impact through energy efficiency, water conservation, and use of sustainable materials. <span id=\"passage-q22\" data-question=\"22\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification system has become a globally recognized standard for green buildings</span>, encouraging developers to adopt environmentally responsible construction practices. Singapore's \"City in a Garden\" vision exemplifies integrated urban greening, where vegetation is incorporated into buildings and infrastructure throughout the city, reducing the urban heat island effect while improving air quality and biodiversity.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q18\" data-question=\"18\"></span>Transportation represents another crucial area for sustainable urban development. <span id=\"passage-q23\" data-question=\"23\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Traditional car-centric urban planning has contributed to traffic congestion, air pollution, and sprawling development patterns</span>. In response, many cities are prioritizing public transit, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly design. Copenhagen has become renowned for its cycling culture, with 62% of residents commuting by bicycle daily. The city's extensive network of cycle tracks, traffic-prioritized intersections for cyclists, and bicycle parking facilities demonstrate how infrastructure investment can shift transportation patterns. Similarly, Curitiba, Brazil, revolutionized urban transport through its Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which combines the capacity of a metro with the flexibility of buses, serving as a model for cities worldwide.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q19\" data-question=\"19\"></span>Smart city technologies are increasingly being deployed to enhance urban sustainability. <span id=\"passage-q24\" data-question=\"24\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">These technologies use data collected from sensors, devices, and citizens to manage assets and resources efficiently</span>. Barcelona's smart city initiative includes intelligent street lighting that adjusts based on pedestrian presence, smart waste bins that signal when they need emptying, and sensors that monitor air quality and noise levels. Such systems optimize resource use, reduce operational costs, and improve quality of life for residents. <span id=\"passage-q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">However, smart city technologies also raise concerns about data privacy and the digital divide between those with access to technology and those without</span>.\n\nThe social dimension of sustainable urban development focuses on creating inclusive, equitable cities. <span id=\"passage-q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Affordable housing remains a critical challenge, as rapid urbanization and gentrification have pushed housing costs beyond the reach of many residents in major cities</span>. Vienna's social housing program, which provides high-quality, affordable homes for 62% of the city's population, demonstrates that well-designed public housing can promote social mixing and community cohesion. <span id=\"passage-q27\" data-question=\"27\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Access to public spaces, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities are also essential components of socially sustainable cities</span>.\n\nThe success of sustainable urban development depends on effective governance and stakeholder engagement. Top-down planning alone is insufficient; meaningful participation from residents, businesses, and civil society organizations is essential. Participatory budgeting, pioneered in Porto Alegre, Brazil, allows citizens to directly influence how public funds are spent in their communities, fostering democratic engagement and ensuring that development priorities reflect local needs. Furthermore, sustainable urban development requires coordination across different government levels and sectors, as urban challenges transcend administrative boundaries and involve multiple policy areas."

            "content": "The History of Timekeeping\n\n<span id=\"passage-q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span>The human fascination with measuring time stretches back thousands of years, driven by practical needs for agriculture, navigation, and social coordination. <span id=\"passage-q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Ancient civilizations developed various methods to track time, with the earliest devices based on observing natural phenomena such as the movement of celestial bodies</span>. The Egyptians, around 3500 BCE, created one of the first timekeeping instruments: the shadow clock or sundial, which used the sun's position to indicate time of day. However, these devices were limited by their dependence on sunlight and clear weather conditions.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span>To overcome the limitations of sundials, ancient peoples developed water clocks, or clepsydras. <span id=\"passage-q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">These devices measured time by the regulated flow of water from one container to another</span>, allowing timekeeping to continue regardless of weather or time of day. The Greeks and Romans refined water clock technology, creating elaborate mechanisms with gears and indicators. In China, around 725 CE, the Buddhist monk Yi Xing created an advanced water-powered astronomical clock that could track celestial movements. <span id=\"passage-q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Despite their improvements over sundials, water clocks still faced challenges, as water flow rates could vary with temperature changes</span>.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span>The mechanical clock represented a revolutionary advancement in timekeeping technology. <span id=\"passage-q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The first mechanical clocks appeared in European monasteries during the 13th century, driven by falling weights and regulated by an escapement mechanism</span>. These early clocks were large, expensive, and primarily used to regulate prayer times. The invention of the coiled spring in the 15th century enabled the creation of smaller, portable timepieces. <span id=\"passage-q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The mainspring allowed for the development of domestic clocks and eventually watches, making personal timekeeping possible for the first time</span>. However, early mechanical timepieces were notoriously inaccurate, losing or gaining several minutes per day.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span>The quest for greater accuracy became particularly urgent with the expansion of maritime exploration. <span id=\"passage-q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Determining longitude at sea required precise timekeeping, as a four-minute error in time measurement could result in a navigational error of one degree longitude, or about 60 nautical miles at the equator</span>. This problem was so critical that the British government established the Longitude Prize in 1714, offering a substantial reward for a reliable solution. John Harrison, an English carpenter and clockmaker, devoted his life to solving this problem, eventually creating the H4 marine chronometer in 1761. <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Harrison's chronometer was accurate to within one-fifth of a second per day, revolutionary precision for the era</span>.\n\nThe 20th century brought dramatic advances in timekeeping accuracy. <span id=\"passage-q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In 1927, the first quartz clock was developed, utilizing the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals to keep time</span>. When an electric current is applied to a quartz crystal, it vibrates at an extremely consistent frequency. These vibrations can be counted and converted into regular time intervals, providing accuracy far superior to mechanical clocks. Quartz technology eventually miniaturized into the affordable, accurate wristwatches that became ubiquitous by the 1980s.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The development of atomic clocks in 1955 represented the pinnacle of timekeeping precision</span>. These devices measure time based on the oscillations of atoms, typically cesium-133, which vibrates at an extraordinarily stable frequency. Modern atomic clocks are so accurate that they would neither gain nor lose a second in millions of years. In 1967, the definition of a second was officially redefined based on atomic oscillations rather than astronomical observations, reflecting the superior precision of atomic timekeeping. Today, atomic clocks form the basis of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which synchronizes time worldwide and enables technologies such as GPS navigation, telecommunications networks, and financial trading systems that require nanosecond-level precision. Recent developments in optical atomic clocks, which use visible light frequencies rather than microwave frequencies, promise even greater accuracy, potentially losing less than one second over the age of the universe."
