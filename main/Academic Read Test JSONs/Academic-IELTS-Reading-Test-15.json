            "title": "Reading Passage 1",
            "content": "New Zealand's Mighty Kauri Tree\n\n<span id=\"passage-q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Found north of the 38 degree South latitude, the native coniferous—meaning cone-bearing and evergreen—Agatha Australis tree is more commonly referred to by its Maori name, the kauri.  A protected species, the indigenous New Zealand kauri trees and kauri forests are amongst the oldest known to man, dating back some 20 million years, with the forerunners of the New Zealand native being placed in the Jurassic period, approximately 150 million years ago.  Other Agatha specimens are spread throughout the southern Pacific regions, but the kauri is located the furthest south, in the north half of the North Island of New Zealand</span>, where it grows from sea level to climates as high as 600 metres.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The kauri tree is not the tallest tree in New Zealand, but it is the largest- and longest-living, growing as high as 50 metres, with a trunk girth that can be measured at over 16 metres and a life-span surpassing 2,000 years, which means some trees were 1,000 years old when the first peoples arrived in New Zealand.</span>  The diameter of the trunk can exceed five metres, which is equal to the giant California sequoias, and is amongst the highest timber-producing trees, owing to their continuous thick trunks extending upwards.  Historians claim that some notable trees reached record measurements, with 'The Great Ghost' near Thames in the Coromandel region growing to over 8 metres in diameter and more than 27 metres in girth, before being lost in a fire around 1890.\n\nYoung kauri trees grow straight up, with branches sprouting the length of the trunk, but, interestingly, the lower branches are shed as the tree reaches greater heights, with huge, clean trunks, and a root structure that burrows up to five metres into the ground.  Some of the largest kauri trees had clean trunks reaching up to 25 metres, and beyond, before the first branches.  The bark of the tree is grey-brown in colour, and flakes off, with a 1- to 2-metre build-up around the base of the tree.  The leaves are oblong, around 5 centimetres in length, and are flat and leather-tough, and the kauri has both male and female seed cones, which are wind-dispersed, and pollinated by either the cone-generating tree or by other trees.\n\nThe uses of the kauri tree are many.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Maori recognized the value of the wood, and made good use of it for house-building purposes, for their native carving, and, importantly, for boat-building.  European settlers also realized the importance of kauri timber.  With its parallel grain and noticeable elasticity and strong length, kauri trunks were honed into superb sailing masts, and the timber was used for the hulls and decks of ships because of its strength and water-tightness, stemming from its resistance to rot.  In addition, kauri became a commodity for trade, as Maori leaders understood its value, and they exchanged it for European provisions, such as food products and muskets.  Finally, kauri gum, which is semi-fossilised kauri resin, was used widely as a varnish and linoleum product, and was dug from marshland areas, and even prized as an export commodity.  It is interesting to note that the gum is also used by the tree to protect itself, because, once hardened, it adds to the tree's strength and durability.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The logging of kauri, after the value of the tree was realised, began in earnest in the 1800s, by both the European settlers and the Maori, who understood its value as an in-demand product and, thus, an exchange commodity, as well as its cultural value.</span>  Because of their size, the trees and logs were both difficult and dangerous to move from the rugged native bush country.  They were floated downstream and, ironically, they were also used to construct dams and locks, to define waterways and to construct aquatic pathways to assist the movement of the massive logs.  Over 3,000 dams and waterways were put together after 1850 to move the felled trees and a growing industry evolved.  However, massive deforestation of the kauri saw the northern part of New Zealand transformed.  By the early 20th Century, kauri forests were devastated, and once it was realised that protection measures would need to be put in place, logging of the tree pushed ahead to ensure the most short-term gain, and, as a result, kauri forests today are scarce and invaluable, and their protection and ongoing viability is a concern.\n\n<span id=\"passage-q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Other problems, besides over-logging, beset the kauri, although to a lesser extent.  Animals, in particular introduced species such as the possum, are a threat to not only the kauri but also other flora.</span>  Other natural predators are the numerous weeds that endanger the native bush because of the warm and wet climate, and, more recently, a fungus mould called Phytophthora taxon Agathis which has taken hold since the 1970s and has caused widespread devastation in many areas, attacking trees at their base and causing them to die.  Worryingly, there appears to be no known cure, and the 'dieback' disease is still being researched by scientists with a view to managing, and understanding, the disease.  Because the disease is easily spread, action has been taken to protect the kauri by limiting human access to the tree in its natural environment and by ensuring a 'clean' approach, as spores and soil are the main medium for the spread of the disease.  <span id=\"passage-q6\" data-question=\"6\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Both government intervention and volunteer work are underway to ensure a healthy future for kauri forests.</span>"
