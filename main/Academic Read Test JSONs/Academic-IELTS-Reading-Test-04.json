            "content": "Earthquakes and how we measure them\r\n\r\nIn the year 1556, an earthquake occurred in China's Shanxi province, and the records show that more than 800,000 people perished. City walls, government buildings, commercial premises, domestic dwellings and temples all collapsed. <span id=\"passage-q12\" data-question=\"12\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">With the analysis of the quake by scholars at the time</span>, scientists and historians today have estimated the power of the quake was particularly strong, registering a magnitude of 8.0. More recent earthquakes have had similarly devastating effects, with <span id=\"passage-q6\" data-question=\"6\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">2010's Haiti earthquake killing more than 300,000 people</span>, and the Indonesian quake in 2004 leading to the loss of more than 225,000 lives, with a magnitude of 9.1. <span id=\"passage-q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The biggest earthquake to be measured occurred in 1960, in Chile, and registered 9.5 on the Richter Scale</span>, as it was used then. This resulted in 1900 deaths and caused an estimated US$4 billion in damage.\r\n\r\nUntil the last few hundred years, very little was known regarding the cause of these natural disasters. <span id=\"passage-q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Early beliefs regarding the causes of earthquakes were put forward by Greek philosophers, who believed that earthquakes could be attributed to air escaping from cavities buried deep in the Earth's centre, or to imbalances between levels of water under the earth. Other theories in other cultures revolved around religious beliefs, with <span id=\"passage-q11\" data-question=\"11\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">ancient Norse, Japanese and Peruvian people believing that the earthquakes showed that the gods were unhappy with the Earth, and the people on it</span></span>. Pliny the Elder, an ancient Roman philosopher, (32 AD) labelled earthquakes as 'underground thunderstorms', and, interestingly, he was probably not far from the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-19th century, Italian researchers developed what was called a seismograph, which was used to measure the motion of the ground during an earthquake. This device recorded what are known as 'ground oscillations' or movements of the earth, and research began to pick up pace. The sensitivity of seismographs improved considerably over the next 50 or so years, but the next major development came in the early 20th century with Charles Richter and Beno Gutenberg of the <span id=\"passage-q10\" data-question=\"10\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">California Institute of Technology in the USA. They modified the seismograph</span> and built what is now known as the Richter Scale, a measuring device used to record the energy released by an earthquake, and further, to compare earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWith this accumulation of data, and further technological advances, British and American researchers put forward a theory in the 1960s to define the causes of earthquakes, a theory referred to as plate tectonics. Simply put, plate tectonics refers to movements gigantic continent-sized geological plates on the Earth's outer shell moving, sometimes imperceptibly, over the layer of the Earth's inner core. It is worth noting that in 1912 the German geophysicist and meteorologist <span id=\"passage-q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Alfred Wegener presented a theory of 'continental drift'</span> – that is, the movement of continents away from and towards each other – but he could not substantiate his theory with scientific proof. <span id=\"passage-q7\" data-question=\"7\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Tectonic plate movement provided that answer</span>. All of this is based on the idea of the earth's having a liquid centre (the molten core), with heat rising in various forms, through magma, sometimes erupting in volcanoes, and the plates sliding back and forth along boundaries, referred to as fault lines. Possibly one of the most famous is the San Andreas fault running through California, which is part of the greater 'Ring of Fire' fault, encircling the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Richter Scale, the product of Richter and Gutenberg's research, measures the level of energy released, garnering data from seismographs, and comparing them. The way that the scale is designed means that a level 6 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a level 5 earthquake, and a level 7 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a level 6, and so on. Using this scale of measurement, <span id=\"passage-q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the 1960 Chile earthquake, measuring 9.5, was five times more powerful than the next highest recorded earthquake, <span id=\"passage-q13\" data-question=\"13\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska</span></span>, which was recorded at 9.0. <span id=\"passage-q8\" data-question=\"8\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Many factors are involved in this calculation</span>, including the depth of the earthquake and whether the quake is below the earth or under the ocean. With regards the depth of the earthquake, standards classify a shallow earthquake as between 9 and 70 kms deep, an intermediate quake is 70 to 300 kms below the earth's surface, and deep earthquakes are 300 – 700 kms deep.\r\n\r\nAnother scale used by scientists is the Mercalli scale, which <span id=\"passage-q9\" data-question=\"9\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">measures the extent of damage</span>, and is a much more subjective measurement. Mercalli measurements are given in Roman numerals from I to XII, with a II registering no noticeable property damage, and a XII recognising major property loss, significant physical alteration to the landscape such as slippages, and related natural disasters, including landslides and tsunamis. Mercalli levels, by their very nature, are determined well after earthquakes, as many other factors need to be included to determine levels which can be substantiated.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes measuring less than 2 on the Richter Scale are known as microquakes, and are <span id=\"passage-q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">often not felt by humans</span> (although animals have a much more perceptive feel for earthquakes, both those that are occurring and those about to occur). Microquakes are frequent, with thousands occurring each year, and moderate earthquakes, those less than 6.0 on the measurable scales, happening less frequently. Major earthquakes occur on the average of once a year, and scientists have noted that an earthquake at the level of 10 or more, which would equate to the major fault lines rupturing simultaneously, would be catastrophic to a hugely disruptive degree, and would be the absolute upper limit. Work continues to both predict, and to understand, earthquakes, and for that, the general public are thankful.\r\n"

            "content": "The secrets of the beaver and their famous dams\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q20\" data-question=\"20\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q20</span></span>A: 'Busy as a beaver.' An expression used in English to indicate a person who is very industrious. But is the beaver, described as a 'giant hyperactive stream-dwelling aquatic rodent', really that busy? The answer is yes, and ingenious as well. The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and its European cousin, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), are what are known as keystone species – that is, animals that have a disproportionately profound effect on their environment compared to their numbers, playing a crucial role in the maintenance of their ecological habitat. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Beavers are well-known for their habit of building barriers (known as dams) in waterways in order create a deep pool of water behind the dam in which to build their homes (known as lodges)</span>. Another common characteristic of the beaver is the use of its large flat tail, which is slaps loudly on the water as a warning to others, to ward off danger or when startled.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"passage-q14\" data-question=\"14\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"reading-text-q21\" data-question=\"21\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q21</span></span>B: <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Beavers, native to North America, can be found as far south as Mexico, and also in Europe. Beavers were introduced into South America</span> to be farmed and hunted for their fur, but this was not successful as there were no natural predators of the beaver in the areas of South America where they were introduced. As a result, they multiplied and caused serious ecological damage. In total, worldwide numbers of beavers were estimated to once be as many as nearly 100 million. However, in North America, the beaver was hunted and trapped, by the indigenous people for its meat and by the settlers for its fur, so that in many areas the beaver was on the verge of extinction. <span id=\"reading-text-q22\" data-question=\"22\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q22</span></span><span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Today, the numbers have recovered and conservationists put the current population at a healthy 10 to 15 million.</span>\r\n\r\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q15\" data-question=\"15\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"reading-text-q23\" data-question=\"23\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q23</span></span>C: Beavers build dams in order to create a pond of water large enough and deep enough to create a moat, to isolate their lodge, or home, from predators and to create an underwater entrance to their lodge. Working at night, beavers fell trees up to 30 or 40 centimetres in diameter, <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">gnawing through the wood with sharp, strong front rodent teeth</span>, breaking trees into smaller lengths and then dragging them to narrow stretches of a stream, forcing them into the stream bed. Then, all forms of natural materials are used to reinforce the structure, ranging from sticks and branches to rocks, mud, and leaves, creating a dam of up to two metres in height, and creating a pool of water up to metres in depth.\r\n\r\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q16\" data-question=\"16\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"reading-text-q24\" data-question=\"24\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q24</span></span>D: The beaver's lodge is usually built using the same materials as the dam, and each autumn, fresh mud is layered on to cover the lodge, which freezes in the colder climes, providing extra protection from predators. In locations where the river is too wide to build a suitable dam, beavers will build into the side of a riverbank to create a home, which is called a 'den', but this process is only used when the natural water level is deep enough to keep underwater entrances hidden from predators. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Beavers mate for life</span> and often live in large extended-family groups, with more than one lodge built close together in units to house the families. As well, beavers mark and protect their territories well, safeguarding their area and their lodges against others of the same species, as well as predators, using their large powerful front teeth to defend their well-built homes and dams.\r\n\r\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q17\" data-question=\"17\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">E: The benefits of the beavers' dam-building skills are plentiful, and the most noticeable is the restoration of large areas of wetlands, which in turn creates more advantages. Flood control increases as a result of the creation of large ponds behind dams, with the dual action of water being released slowly through the dam during periods of heavy rain, and, equally, in dry stretches, stored water continues to flow, aiding irrigation. Other ecological benefits are the removal of various agricultural chemicals which seep into the water system from farmland runoff, chemicals such as excess nutrients like phosphates and nitrates in fertilizers, and toxins in pesticides and herbicides, the dam acting as a natural filter. In addition, there is a rich build-up of silt which aids farm productivity and becomes available when beavers abandon their dams.\r\n\r\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q18\" data-question=\"18\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"reading-text-q25\" data-question=\"25\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q25</span></span>F: Animal life, in particular, benefits greatly from the role of the beaver as a keystone species. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">The increase in wetlands adds to the rich diversity of animal life</span>, with one claim stating that almost half of North America's endangered species are dependent on wetlands for their survival. Further, the water build-up behind dams acts as a nursery for fish species, such as trout and salmon, while frog and toad populations increase because beaver ponds create a protected environment for larva and tadpoles to mature in warm water rich in oxygen. Finally, birdlife prospers in a thriving environment full of plantlife, foodstocks and a protected habitat.\r\n\r\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"passage-q19\" data-question=\"19\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\"><span id=\"reading-text-q26\" data-question=\"26\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q26</span></span>G: However, the industriousness of the beaver does present some downsides. Beaver ponds which are created behind dams can actually cause flooding when the dam breaks, releasing a large amount of water in a very short space of time. This can result in property damage, commercial disruption with roads, railway tracks and bridges threatened, and <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">the loss of farm crops and timber resources</span>. One report for the U.S. timber industry estimated losses at more than US$22 million in a single year. Felled trees can also present hazards to power lines or lead to power outages. There is a fine line to be managed as governments and conservationists look to control beaver activities, not losing their beneficial outputs but at the same time limiting their damage, so various human trapping and re-location approaches are employed to allow the animal to work its environmental magic in the most efficient manner.\r\n\r\n</span>\n\nH: Recognising the beaver as an important animal in the early days of Canada's economic development through its integral part in the fur trade, 1975 saw the beaver adopted as Canada's national animal, now appearing on the 5- cent coin. Various U.S. states have used the beaver as an organizational symbol and it is also used by many educational institutes in their logos and coats of arms, including the London School of Economics, with its Latin inscription: Rerum Cognoscere Causas, meaning, 'To know the cause of things'. With the beaver, it is the cause of much good in the grand environmental scheme."

One estimate put forward is that <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">PM emissions contributed to 87,000 global premature deaths in 2012 and these large port cities like Hong Kong and Busan in Asia, Rotterdam and Antwerp in Europe and Los Angeles/Long Beach in the Americas have borne the brunt of the health issues</span> created by the growing volume of heavy emissions from the maritime industry.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q29\" data-question=\"29\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q29</span></span>Globally, there are more than 90,000 vessels in the international marine fleet, handling over 90% of international trade. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Heavy fuel oil has been the mainstay of energy and propulsion requirements</span> through the second half of the 20th century as global trade has become the lifeblood of economic growth, but it is acknowledged that this same shipping now accounts for nearly 10% of the total emissions of SO2, which has been responsible for the environmentally devastating acid rain, and is a heavy contributor to respiratory problems and other illnesses in humans. In the United States alone, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 14,000 premature deaths annually owing to toxic emissions, and it is noted that the fuel used by ocean-plying vessels is 600 times dirtier than land transport diesel fuel.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q30\" data-question=\"30\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q30</span></span>Once it was recognised that there was a strong causal relationship between pollutant emissions and health issues, <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">the International Maritime Organisation, or IMO, a UN agency that sets and regulates industry standards for safety and the environment, began formulating guidelines to determine and control safe standards for emissions</span>. Beginning in 2015, the IMO ruled that the first areas to be designated as Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, would be the Exclusive Economic Zones of North America and Northern Europe, where Marine Gas Oil with a permitted sulphur content of only 1,000 ppm (parts per million) would be allowed. <span id=\"reading-text-q31\" data-question=\"31\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q31</span></span>This was a dramatic proposal, as the then-current sulphur content of what are called bunker fuels ranged as high as 35,000 ppm. Further, from the year 2020, <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">the regulation is that all vessels sailing outside any ECA must cap their emissions at 5,000 ppm</span>.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q32\" data-question=\"32\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q32</span></span><span id=\"reading-text-q39\" data-question=\"39\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q39</span></span>But all this comes at a huge economic cost, <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">not only for the commercial enterprises, but also the shipping companies and, by extension, their shippers, and the national economies of the countries involved</span>. As a result, much research has gone into determining the best approach to 'clean up', or even change, the fuel, and ultimately there seems to be two main approaches to comply with the requirements. Firstly, <span id=\"passage-q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the oil industry would have to drop the sulphur content of the fuel from 3.5% to 0.5%</span>, which would achieve the required emissions levels, or <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">vessels would have to be fitted with what are known as 'scrubbers', technology that can clean the emissions</span>. However, it is recognised that the refining industry is not yet moving towards complying with the regulations regarding sulphur content, and as far as scrubbing is concerned, at an estimated US$4 million per engine fit out, the cost is often too high for many shipping countries.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q34\" data-question=\"34\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q34</span></span><span id=\"reading-text-q35\" data-question=\"35\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q35</span></span>In addition, along with other industries such as land transport and airline companies, much research is being conducted into looking at alternative fuels. For shipping, this revolves around investigating alternative sources such as Liquid (or Liquefied) Natural Gas, solar fuel cells, <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">wind (an ironic twist on where shipping originally began)</span> and the controversial <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">nuclear energy, used in many naval fleets</span>. However, apart from the view that HFO is the cheapest alternative and that the merchant fleet is geared towards the continuing use of HFO, each alternative also presents some challenges. Natural gas takes up a large amount of storage on a vessel, thus reducing cargo-carrying capacity. Likewise, solar fuel cells, although effective, require huge amount of space and wind is not considered reliable enough. Nuclear energy remains a contentious issue, and many ports will restrict or deny entry to nuclear-powered vessels.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q36\" data-question=\"36\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q36</span></span><span id=\"reading-text-q37\" data-question=\"37\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q37</span></span>At the same time, the international shipping trade is experiencing a serious down-turn in profits. In 2007, the average daily revenue of a merchant vessel was US$34,000 but in 2017 that same figure was just US$9800, according to Clarkson Research, a global shipping consultancy firm. Part of this decline in profits is due to an excess of shipping vessels, but it also relates to the 2008 global financial crisis, and changes in the oil and export markets. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">All this means there will be a reluctance on the part of ship-owners, national state carriers and major shippers to contribute towards a scheme that, while benefiting the global environment and national health interests, sees little direct economic return.</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q38\" data-question=\"38\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q38</span></span>But the way forward is appearing. Gas-powered vessels are now operating, with its cleaner and more efficient fuel. Which, interestingly, has given rise to what is known as the \"fifth fuel\", that is energy efficiency. Because fuel traditionally accounts for up to half of all costs involved in shipping, there have always been innovative energy-saving approaches. One example is that <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">during the 2008 global crisis in finance and costs, sailing speeds on ocean vessels were reduced by oftentimes up to half, which resulted in massive fuel savings</span>. This has given rise to what is known as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, a compulsory outline of regulations that means that all new ships will be required to adhere to it from 2015.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"reading-text-q40\" data-question=\"40\"><span class=\"question-marker-badge\">Q40</span></span><span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Heavy Fuel Oil, however, will be the backbone of energy for the foreseeable future.</span> If engine scrubbers are deployed, and are as effective as engineered, they can capture more than 90% of exhaust sulphur and they will continue to be the main force in energy requirements. <span class=\"reading-text-answer-marker\">Lloyds Registry, the industry classification organisation, believes that HFO will still make up nearly half of all fuels used in the maritime industry in 2030</span>, albeit with the agreed-upon restrictions set out."
