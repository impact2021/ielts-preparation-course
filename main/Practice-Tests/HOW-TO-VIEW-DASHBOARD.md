## ⚠️ Why GitHub Doesn't Show HTML Directly

GitHub displays HTML files as source code for security reasons. To view them as web pages, you need to use one of the methods above.

---

## 📌 Recommended Solution

**For immediate use:**
Use **raw.githack.com** link (fastest, works immediately)

**For permanent use:**
Set up **GitHub Pages** once and use the permanent URL

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If raw.githack.com doesn't work:**
- Make sure the branch is `main` (not `master`)
- Wait 30 seconds after committing for the file to sync
- Try HTMLPreview.github.io instead

**If GitHub Pages doesn't work:**
- Check that Pages is enabled in Settings
- Verify the branch and folder are set correctly
- Wait 1-2 minutes for the first deployment
