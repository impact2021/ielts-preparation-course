      "content": "DWARF PLANET<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Discovery, Classification and Exploration of Pluto<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A: </strong><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">On the 14th of July, 2015, a NASA deep space probe called New Horizons flew through <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the Pluto system in the Kuiper belt</span>, located almost 6 billion kilometres from our sun</span>, gathering high resolution photographs of the dwarf planet and its moons. Scientifically, the aims of the New Horizons mission were to provide experts on Earth with greater detail regarding the geomorphology, atmosphere, magnetosphere and surface composition of Pluto. As well as cameras for high resolution imagery, the spacecraft used an array of on-board scientific equipment to obtain information, including remote sensors, radio transmitters, computer subsystems, a large satellite dish and a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>B: </strong>Pluto was discovered in February, 1930, by the American Charles Tombaugh, a young self-taught astronomer working at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Tombaugh, then in his early twenties, detected the existence of the planet by examining anomalies in photographic plates with the aid of a special viewing apparatus <span id=\"q22\" data-question=\"22\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">known as a blink microscope</span>. His discovery soon made worldwide news headlines, and on the 25th of May, 1930, the members of the Lowell Observatory chose the name of Pluto for the ninth planet in the Solar System by unanimous vote. The name itself comes from that of the Roman god of the underworld, and was suggested by a schoolgirl living in England, whose uncle, a retired university librarian, had passed on her suggestion through academic acquaintances. <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">It has been rumoured that Pluto's discovery served as inspiration for Walt Disney's canine character of the same name</span>. There is, however, no question surrounding the naming of the element plutonium, which was named after the planet following the creation of the former by a team of scientists at the University of California in the early 1940s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>C: </strong>The estimated mass of Pluto was steadily revised downwards in the decades following its discovery, and was not accurately calculated until 1978, the same year in which Charon, the largest of the planet's five moons, was discovered by the United States Naval Observatory astronomer <span id=\"q23\" data-question=\"23\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">James Christy</span>. While the original estimate of Pluto's mass had been seven times that of Earth, Christy and his colleague, Robert Harrington, compared Charon's orbital period and size with those of Pluto, estimating the planet's mass to be approximately 0.2 per cent that of the earth. A pair of smaller satellites, Nix and Hydra, was subsequently identified in 2005, with <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the final two of Pluto's known moons, named Kerberos and Styx, being discovered in 2011 and 2012 respectively</span>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>D: </strong>However, in spite of having been regarded as the ninth planet in the solar system for more than fifty years, Pluto's status and classification began to come into question towards the close of the twentieth century. Initially, this was due to the fact that during the nineties a number of objects, made of rock and ice and of a similar size to Pluto, were discovered lying within the Kuiper belt, a circumstellar disc, in many ways resembling a gigantic asteroid belt, at the edge of the Solar System beyond Neptune. The first of these new Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) was identified in 1992 by a pair of astronomers, David Jewitt and Jane Luu, working out of the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Many more Kuiper Belt Objects were found in the years that followed, making Pluto's official status as a planet increasingly controversial among many in the scientific community. While Pluto remains, at present, the largest of the known trans-Neptunian objects located in the Kuiper belt, the discovery in 2005 of a minor planet with a greater mass, Eris, in an outlying region of the Kuiper belt known as <span id=\"q24\" data-question=\"24\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the scattered disc</span>, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to create a formal definition of the term \"planet\" that excluded Pluto.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>E: </strong>When the New Horizons interplanetary space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral in January, 2006, its primary mission was to voyage to Pluto, at that time the only remaining unexplored planet in the Solar System. However, in August of the same year, at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) held in <span id=\"q25\" data-question=\"25\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the Czech Republic</span>, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet on account of the fact that it did not meet one of the three formal conditions required to be classed as a planet. According to the official definition of the IAU, a planet must be in orbit around the sun and have sufficient mass both for its own gravity to make it spherical in shape and <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">to have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects. Failing to meet the third of these criteria, Pluto was classified as a \"dwarf planet\"</span>. While the decision of the IAU to reduce the number of planets in the Solar System from nine to eight has received its fair share of both praise and criticism, the definition of Pluto as a dwarf planet, while controversial, remains in use. Today, there are five known bodies in the Solar System that have been recognised by the IAU as dwarf planets. In addition to Pluto, these are Ceres, Haumea, Makemake and Eris. At the same time, it has been estimated that there may be hundreds more as yet undiscovered and unclassified dwarf planets throughout the Solar System.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>F: </strong>The high resolution images of Pluto made during the New Horizons close flyby of the planet and beamed back to Earth from across the Solar System have revealed a unique terrain. Far from being a flat, dead world, the rocky dwarf planet's surface contains a multitude of varied, complex landscapes, ranging from oddly-textured ridges with the appearance of tree bark or dragon scales, ice cliffs, valleys and mountains and frozen lakes and oceans to heavily cratered and pitted plains. Experts theorise that, <span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">in addition to the impact of other space bodies colliding with the planet, the majority of its terrain has been shaped by a combination of ice sublimation and tectonic forces</span>. While still awaiting official approval from the International Astronomical Union, names for a number of Pluto's regions and topographical features have already been proposed by the New Horizons discovery team in consultation with the general public, including Tombaugh Regio, the Brass Knuckles, Tartarus Dorsa and <span id=\"q26\" data-question=\"26\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Cthulhu Regio</span>, the latter named after a fictional deity from the works of American author H.P. Lovecraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>G: </strong>Irrespective of its official present classification as a dwarf planet, the New Horizons reconnaissance of Pluto provides a wealth of knowledge and data regarding the last major body in the Solar System not previously visited by a space probe. While the planet, spacecraft and New Horizons team may be comparatively small, the mission to the Pluto system not only represents the culmination of more than a decade's worth of preparation on Earth, but also the beginning of a new chapter in space exploration at the edge of the Solar System and beyond."

      "content": "A: <span id=\"q28\" data-question=\"28\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">The Nobel Prize was first introduced in 1895, and now, over a century later, they are still highly respected awards. Presented to those individuals and organizations that make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine</span>, they are named after Alfred Nobel, the man who initially pioneered the idea. Yet the Prizes had an unlikely start; Nobel\u2019s contribution to science was actually the creation of dynamite. <span id=\"q29\" data-question=\"29\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">It was only when a French newspaper mistakenly believed Nobel had died, and subsequently printed an obituary referring to him as the \u2018Merchant of Death\u2019, that Nobel realised the full impact of the legacy he was leaving behind. He decided that after his death, a significant portion of his wealth should be devoted to seeking out and acknowledging those who had made \u2018the greatest contribution to mankind\u2019.</span> <span id=\"q30\" data-question=\"30\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">However, it was not until 5 years after his death that the first prizes were handed out \u2013 complications with the will and disagreements among his surviving relatives meant that the process was set back.</span><br /><br />\r\n\r\nB: Each recipient received \u2013 and still receives \u2013 a medal, a diploma and a monetary award. As of 2010, 817 individuals and 23 organizations had been awarded a Nobel Prize. <span id=\"q34\" data-question=\"34\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Yet not every winner, referred to as a \u2018laureate\u2019, has actually accepted the award.</span> In the 1930s, three German winners were not permitted by their government to accept the Nobel Prize, and <span id=\"q31\" data-question=\"31\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak into declining his award in 1958</span>. In 1964, Jean Paul Sartre, a French writer, also declined the award, although this was not politically motivated \u2013 he simply did not accept any official honour.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nC: <span id=\"q32\" data-question=\"32\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Of all the recipients of Nobel Prizes, only one organisation or person has been awarded the honour multiple times \u2013 the Red Cross (which has been awarded a Prize three times).</span> <span id=\"q35\" data-question=\"35\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Another interesting statistic is that less than 5 percent of Nobel prizes have been awarded to women, the first of whom was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.</span> Also, <span id=\"q33\" data-question=\"33\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">since its inception, there have been two occasions where no winner was found for the prizes \u2013 in 1941 and 1942</span>. This was largely due to the world war that was being waged at the time.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nD: <span id=\"q36\" data-question=\"36\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">In 1969, having been running for nearly seventy years, a sixth area was introduced to the Nobel Prizes \u2013 economics.</span> This was not a category defined in Nobel\u2019s will, but was established by Sweden\u2019s central bank in 1968 on the Bank\u2019s 300th anniversary. Since this time, no categories have been added or removed from the prizegiving.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nE: There are of course certain rules governing who can be selected for a Nobel prize. You cannot nominate yourself, nor can a person be nominated after their death. <span id=\"q37\" data-question=\"37\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">However, it is possible to award a prize to someone who is dead as long as they were alive during the nomination process.</span> Each year, between 100 and 250 people are nominated.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nF: Arguably the most well-known of the Nobel prizes is the Nobel Peace Prize. According to the terms of Nobel\u2019s will, it is not the Swedish Academy of Science nor the Academy of Arts (both of which select the recipient for the other prizes); instead, the Peace Prize is awarded by 5 people selected by the Norwegian parliament. But it is not just these 5 people who are carefully chosen \u2013 even those who have the right to nominate others are selected from a narrow selection of candidates. Members of national assemblies and governments, as well as selected international governmental bodies, university professors of history, political science, philosophy, law and theology, university presidents and directors of peace research and international affairs institutes, as well as former recipients are among the privileged few.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nG: For a nomination to be considered, only one acceptable nominator needs to suggest the name, but a shortlist of nominees, and the final recipient, is decided by the Nobel Institute, comprising of the 5 people selected by the Norwegian Parliament, as mentioned before.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nH: <span id=\"q38\" data-question=\"38\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Although there is always the aim of reaching a unanimous verdict amongst those judging, there are times when this has not always been the case. In fact, some of the judging panel have resigned following a final decision that they felt was not correct</span>; since its inception, the Peace Prize nominees have included people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini (although they were not awarded the prize). On the other side, there are certain people who are in many ways synonymous with the struggle for peace yet have not been recognised \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi, for example, was nominated 5 times but never actually won an award.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nI: <span id=\"q39\" data-question=\"39\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Unsurprisingly, there have been a number of controversial winners of the Nobel Peace prize over the last 100 years. In the 1940s, Cordell Hull won the Peace Prize for his efforts in putting together the United Nations, but this was in many respects overshadowed by allegations that he campaigned against allowing a boat of Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime to seek asylum in America.</span> <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Anti-Semitic allegations tarnished the prize awarded to John Forbes Nash, who was himself suffering from schizophrenia (a disease which is considered to have impacted on some of his more public comments).</span> Rumours also surrounded Wangari Maathai, a scientist and the first African woman to receive the award, with some claiming that she had aimed certain aggressive remarks at non-African scientists. <span id=\"q40\" data-question=\"40\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">A claim was also publicly made against the successful nomination of Barack Obama, with the award being given for \u2018outstanding international diplomatic efforts\u2019 only 12 days after he took office, with many claiming that the nomination and award were politically motivated.</span><br /><br />\r\n\r\nJ: But regardless of the controversies, allegations and history of Nobel, there is no doubt that for many countries, and many people, the Nobel Prizes are a welcome recognition of efforts in a wide range of fields. The award ceremony has, in recent years, become something of a global media event. There is a \u2018Peace Prize Concert\u2019 which is broadcast to over 450 million households in over 150 countries.\r\n"
