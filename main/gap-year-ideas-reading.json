      "content": "<h3>Gap Year Ideas</h3>\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> A growing number of students are electing to take a 'gap year', a year off to travel before going to university, sometimes even mid-way between studies or after graduation and prior to joining the workforce. <span id=\"q6\" data-question=\"6\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">This trend, according to Careers Advice Counsellor Scott Bradley, is motivated by the urge to experience different cultures first-hand.</span> Companies specialising in gap year organisation often offer subsidies for accommodation and other expenses, making this a financially viable option for those who set their hearts on it and are willing to work to amass the remainder of the expenses involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B.</strong> The majority of gap year programmes organised in such a way involve working in regions requiring external assistance with their development; Melissa Hedges, Director of GYOME (Gap Year Organisation Made Easy) says work placements may involve teaching English to local children, farm work or infrastructure development projects. Since participants in the programmes are helping to bring genuine benefit to impoverished areas, such an experience can be not only personally rewarding, but helpful with future employment searches, employers often holding the view that travel and in particular voluntary work overseas help to develop maturity, independence and team-building skills in potential graduate employees. Employment Agency Consultant Lucy Clarke says such experience can add tremendous value to applicants' resumes and positively impact on their success at reaching interview stage. <span id=\"q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">She adds that it is helpful for students to plan a gap year placement which will involve functions and responsibilities somehow related to their chosen future career if at all possible</span>, though Scott Bradley warns that some students from some particular study disciplines may find that their own industry is less receptive to the advantages of a gap year than others. For example, graduates of a technology-related degree could find themselves at a disadvantage on their return as knowledge and applications within the industry are so dynamic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C.</strong> Since gap year placements are often in developing areas traditionally unused to regular intrusions from outside, it is important that visitors endeavour to follow an ethical code of conduct and act responsibly. The idea, after all, is to add value to the new environment and the lives of people living in that area and not to in any way damage systems and standards already in place. Sociology graduate Katrina Watkins, who has recently completed a gap year assignment, advises that responses to begging need to be carefully considered. She believes that in the developing world a few coins casually discarded can amount to a significant sum of money in the local currency. <span id=\"q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">\"While over the short term currency earned from or given by visitors to locals is no doubt beneficial on an individual level, the long term effects on the society as a whole can also be damaging, if for example, children are encouraged to stay away from school and are dissuaded from gaining an education because time spent generating money from tourists is considered more lucrative\" she added.</span> Steven Davison, a second gap year veteran, suggests alternative approaches to helping the local community could be to make a donation via a local charity, participate in a community assistance programme or volunteer at a local orphanage; his belief being that any of these options are far more beneficial and productive over the long term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>D.</strong> Katrina Watkins strongly recommends that it is useful to research the culture of the destination country as much as possible before arrival. <span id=\"q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Adding that knowledge of a few phrases and words is extremely useful and inevitably well received by the locals</span>, Davison agrees and says it is important for participants to be reminded that an understanding of the dress code and any social taboos is vital to help new arrivals avoid causing offence. It can be extremely offensive in some areas to display shoulders or wear short trousers and certain gestures or body language may have a totally different interpretation. Cultural Researcher Thomas Rogers, says it is also important to be aware of the rules of photography as for some societies, particularly tribal societies, the camera can be an intimidating tool which can cause great distress if photographs are taken without permission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E.</strong> In the same way, whilst respecting the culture of our destination it is equally important to respect the new environment we find ourselves in. It is highly likely that power and water supplies will be far less abundant than at home. <span id=\"q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Environmentalist Dr Stuart Bromley holds that travellers should be sure to carry bio-degradable soaps and washing powders, avoid using such products in streams and in lakes and keep water usage to a minimum by refraining from leaving taps running and suchlike.</span> Wherever we are in the world it is important to never litter and dispose of rubbish responsibly; in particular, non-degradable packaging such as bottles, cans and plastic should be kept to a minimum and never discarded in areas where animals may gain access and damage themselves as a result.</p>\n\n<p><strong>F.</strong> Melissa Hedges says that protection of the environment and the indigenous culture when travelling is of paramount importance; all of her recruits are required to attend an intensive Orientation and Advice workshop prior to embarking on their adventure. Bromley believes that visitors who behave responsibly and with caution, particularly those intending to participate in some work project or other can benefit their destination and its population enormously. <span id=\"q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">Before embarking on a gap year, according to Steven Davison, it is advisable for participants to research ethical holiday providers, work placement schemes and ecotourism information sites in order to ensure that the largest contribution to the area can be made and that the trip can be as enjoyable and safe as possible.</span></p>"
