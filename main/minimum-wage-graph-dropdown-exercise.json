The UK remained substantially/considerably lower than the other countries (around 20-30% compared to 40-50%). In IELTS Task 1, use 'significantly' to emphasize notable differences or changes in data. This fits with the overall pattern where the UK was described as having 'the lowest' position and the 'most dramatic' changes."
