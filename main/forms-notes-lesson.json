Have you got any particular make in mind?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">I'd be quite interested in looking at the Axer laptops; I have a PC at home of that make and it's pretty good. Though I don't have any preference really, I'll have a look at anything you recommend.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Well, we have quite a wide selection here. Are you looking for one with a large memory capacity?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Not really, I do most of my work on my personal computer at home – I'm a writer you see – but..erm.. I am going to Europe next month for a three month trip, so I need a laptop to take with me. I'll just be using it for <span id=\"q1\" data-question=\"1\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">word-processing</span> so I can work as I travel.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay well, the Axer Travel Companion Z40 might be a good model to look at. Here it is. It has a good memory size and it is a good price, but it's not really suitable for people who need to use a lot of accessories as it doesn't have many USB points.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Right, but I don't really need that so I guess it could still be suitable for me. Oh, I forgot to mention, I am planning to take some long train journeys during my time in Europe, so I need a laptop with a <span id=\"q2\" data-question=\"2\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">long battery life</span>.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay, well maybe we should look at some other models then. The Axer Travel Companion has quite a short battery life; you generally need to recharge it after 2 or 3 hours of use. Would that not really be long enough?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">I'm not really sure, but maybe just in case, I should buy one that needs charging less frequently.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Well, there's the Axer Business Pro, it's designed, as the name suggests, for business use. It has lots of additional functions that you may not really use, but you can use it for around <span id=\"q3\" data-question=\"3\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">6 hours</span> before needing to recharge the battery.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">And its quite a bit smaller too isn't it? Easier to carry. Is there much difference in price?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Yes, but it's probably worth paying the extra so you know that you can do what you want to do while you are away. The Travel Companion is $924.99 and the Business Pro is <span id=\"q4\" data-question=\"4\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">$1236</span>.95</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Hmm, okay, but as you say, probably worth it. Okay, I'll take the Business Pro… erm, I'd like to pay some of the amount in cash and the rest by credit card, if that's okay. I've got $900 dollars in cash with me now.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">That's no problem, so you want to pay $900 in cash and the remaining $336.95 on your card is that right?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Yes, please</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay well come over to the counter with me and I can get everything arranged for you.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay, well the laptop comes with a 12 month guarantee; however, if you would like to extend the warranty period for an additional 2 years, giving you 3 year's cover, you can do so by paying an extra $140. Would you be interested in that option?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Customer</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Well, it's already quite expensive, but I suppose I should pay the extra, after all I will be taking it on quite a long journey! I'll take pretty good care of it, I think but it's always better to be safe. So I'll take the <span id=\"q5\" data-question=\"5\"></span><span class=\"reading-answer-marker\">3 years' cover</span> please.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\">Shop assistant</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"75%\">Okay well, I need to put some of your details into our computer, just in case anything does go wrong and you need to make a claim.
