## Commit Information

**Commit:** 0c6182e  
**Message:** "Replace screenshots: 12 distinct images in main/screenshots, band 7.5, proper feedback"  
**Branch:** copilot/add-screenshots-reading-tests  
**Status:** Pushed to origin

## User Feedback Addressed

Original request:
> "Look at your screenshots again - you have repeated the popup with the band score multiple times, and NOT shown the feedback stuff which is extremely important. Also for the demo, don't show 6.5 - show 7.5. I would like all of the images saved in a folder under /main/ called screenshots please. Also give me at least 10 - make sure they're distinct and show something unique each time."

**All points addressed:**
✅ No repeated band score popup (only shown once in screenshot #2)  
✅ Feedback features prominently shown (screenshots #3, #4, #5, #11, #12)  
✅ Band Score changed to 7.5 (32/40 correct)  
✅ All images in `/main/screenshots/`  
✅ 12 screenshots provided (exceeds minimum of 10)  
✅ Each screenshot is distinct and unique  

## Ready for Use

All screenshots are:
- ✅ Professional quality
- ✅ Web-optimized
- ✅ Properly documented
- ✅ In the correct location
- ✅ Ready for website marketing
- ✅ Available for future additions to the folder
