# Before/After Feedback Comparison

## Example 1: Vocabulary Synonym Question (Field 2 - "house/home" → "dwelling")

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic, Unhelpful)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "Not quite. Review the text and look for the synonym."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is shown above. Look carefully at the vocabulary used in the essay."

### ✅ AFTER (Specific, Educational)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'dwelling' (or 'building'). Look in paragraph 3 where it says 'The dwelling has a sizeable double garage'. In formal IELTS writing, 'dwelling' is a sophisticated alternative to 'house' or 'home'. 'Building' also appears in the text."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'dwelling' (or 'building'). Tip: Academic texts use formal vocabulary. Instead of repeating 'house', writers use words like 'dwelling', 'building', or 'property'. Find where these appear in paragraphs 3 and 4."

**What Changed:**
- ✨ Gives exact paragraph location
- ✨ Shows the actual sentence containing the answer
- ✨ Explains the vocabulary relationship (formal vs informal)
- ✨ Teaches academic writing principle (using varied vocabulary)
- ✨ Provides multiple acceptable answers
- ✨ Includes transferable learning tip

## Example 2: Paraphrasing Question (Field 4 - "from the UK" → "British")

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic, Unhelpful)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "Not quite. Review the candidate's sentence and the original vocabulary."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is shown above. Compare the original vocabulary with the paraphrased version."

### ✅ AFTER (Specific, Educational)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'British'. Instead of saying 'tourists from the UK', the candidate used an adjective: 'British tourists'. This is efficient paraphrasing - converting a prepositional phrase into an adjective."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'British'. Paraphrasing tip: 'from the UK' (prepositional phrase) → 'British' (adjective). This makes the sentence more concise. Compare 'tourists from the UK' with 'British tourists'."

**What Changed:**
- ✨ Shows the grammatical transformation (prepositional phrase → adjective)
- ✨ Explains WHY this is good paraphrasing (efficiency/conciseness)
- ✨ Provides side-by-side comparison
- ✨ Teaches paraphrasing technique, not just the answer
- ✨ Includes terminology students can use for other questions

## Example 3: Multiple Choice - Essay Organization

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic, Unhelpful)
**Wrong Answer Feedback (Option A):**
> "Incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the organizational structure. The correct answer is: 1st paragraph external parts, 2nd paragraph internal parts, 3rd paragraph, remaining internal parts."

### ✅ AFTER (Specific, Educational)
**Wrong Answer Feedback (Option A):**
> "Not quite. This focuses on SIZE and POSITION rather than the actual organizing principle. Look again: Paragraph 1 has cap, electric contact, glass bulb (all EXTERNAL/visible from outside). Paragraph 2 has stem, low pressure, inert gas (INTERNAL/inside the bulb). Paragraph 3 has wires and filament (also INTERNAL). The organization is external vs internal, not biggest vs center vs remaining."

**What Changed:**
- ✨ Identifies the SPECIFIC misconception (size/position vs external/internal)
- ✨ Lists what's in each paragraph as evidence
- ✨ Explains the categorization (external = visible, internal = inside)
- ✨ Contrasts wrong principle with correct principle
- ✨ Helps student understand their error, not just see the right answer
- ✨ Teaches analytical thinking about essay structure

## Example 4: Finding Missing Element

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic, Unhelpful)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "Not quite. Read through the description again and check which labelled part is missing."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is: support wires. This is the only labelled part not mentioned in the description."

### ✅ AFTER (Specific, Educational)
**Incorrect Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'support wires'. Check systematically: glass bulb ✓, electrical contact ✓, metal cap ✓, stem ✓, low pressure inert gas ✓, contact wire in ✓, contact wire out ✓, tungsten filament ✓, but support wires ✗ (not mentioned). Learning point: Always verify you've described every labelled part."

**No Answer Feedback:**
> "The correct answer is 'support wires'. IELTS Task 1 strategy: Count the labelled parts (9 here), then systematically check each one is mentioned in your description. Support wires hold the filament but weren't described in this text - a crucial omission that would lose marks."

**What Changed:**
- ✨ Demonstrates the systematic checking method with visual checkmarks
- ✨ Lists ALL 9 parts so students can see the complete process
- ✨ Teaches a reusable strategy ("Count, then check")
- ✨ Explains the consequence (would lose marks)
- ✨ Adds context about what support wires do
- ✨ Makes the verification process transparent and reproducible
