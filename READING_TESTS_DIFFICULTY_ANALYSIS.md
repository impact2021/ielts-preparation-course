## Vocabulary Complexity Examples

### Appropriate IELTS Vocabulary (Test 05 - Bar Codes):
> "The barcode was patented in 1952 by Norman Woodland and Bernard Silver, who conceived the idea while studying at Drexel Institute of Technology."

**Analysis:** Technical topic but vocabulary is accessible, concepts explained clearly ✓

### Excessive Complexity (Test 20 - Ocean Acidification):
> "The reduction in available carbonate ions makes it more difficult for calcifying organisms such as corals, mollusks, and certain plankton species to construct and maintain their calcium carbonate structures, with pteropods showing particular vulnerability as their aragonite shells dissolve in increasingly acidic conditions."

**Analysis:** Multiple specialized terms (carbonate ions, calcifying organisms, pteropods, aragonite) in single sentence requiring chemistry and marine biology background ✗

### Excessive Complexity (Test 20 - Ancient Navigation):
> "Islands create distinctive wave interference patterns—swells reflect off shorelines, creating secondary waves that intersect with primary swells at characteristic angles. Experienced navigators could detect these patterns through subtle changes in boat motion, identifying land's direction and approximate distance."

**Analysis:** Requires understanding of physics (wave interference), oceanography (swell patterns), and spatial reasoning ✗
