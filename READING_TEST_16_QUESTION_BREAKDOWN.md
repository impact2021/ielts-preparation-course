## Changes Made to Correct Question Count

### Original Issue:
The test had **45 questions** instead of the standard **40 questions** for IELTS Academic Reading.

### Corrections Applied:

1. **Fixed Passage Assignment** (5 questions):
   - Questions 14-18 (Short Answer about color psychology) had `reading_text_id: null`
   - Changed to `reading_text_id: 1` to correctly assign them to Passage 2

2. **Removed Questions from Passage 3** (5 questions):
   - **Removed**: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) - Matching question
   - **Removed**: Fog harvesting - Matching question
   - **Removed**: Drip irrigation - Matching question
   - **Removed**: Climate change mitigation strategies - True/False question
   - **Removed**: Metal-organic frameworks humidity extraction - True/False question

### Rationale:
- Standard IELTS Academic Reading tests have exactly 40 questions
- Typical distribution is 13-14 questions per passage
- Passage 3 originally had 19 questions, which was excessive
- Removing 5 questions from Passage 3 brought it to 14 questions
- Final distribution (13-13-14) matches standard IELTS format
