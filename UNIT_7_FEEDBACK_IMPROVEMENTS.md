# Unit 7 Feedback Improvements

## Problem Identified
The original feedback for Unit 7: Describing Diagrams in Task 1 was pedagogically weak:
- **Too generic**: Messages like "Not quite. Review the text and look for the synonym."
- **Not helpful**: Didn't guide students on HOW to find the answer or WHY they got it wrong
- **Missed learning opportunities**: No teaching of strategies or vocabulary patterns

## Solutions Implemented

### Question 1: Vocabulary Synonym Finding (10 fields)

**Before:**
- ❌ Incorrect: "Not quite. Review the text and look for the synonym."
- ❌ No answer: "The correct answer is shown above. Look carefully at the vocabulary used in the essay."

**After (Examples):**
- ✅ Incorrect: "The correct answer is 'common'. Look at the very first sentence where it describes 'the common design of a house'. In academic writing, 'common' and 'typical' both mean 'usual' or 'standard'."
- ✅ No answer: "The correct answer is 'common'. Tip: Start by reading the first sentence - it often contains key vocabulary. Here, 'common design' means the same as 'typical design'."

**Improvements:**
1. **Specific location hints**: "Look at the very first sentence", "Look in paragraph 3"
2. **Contextual examples**: Shows the exact phrase from the text
3. **Vocabulary teaching**: Explains what synonyms mean and why they work
4. **Learning strategies**: "Tip: Start by reading the first sentence..."
5. **Academic writing insights**: "In formal writing, 'dwelling' is a sophisticated alternative..."

### Question 2: Paraphrasing Task (6 fields)

**Before:**
- ❌ Incorrect: "Not quite. Review the candidate's sentence and the original vocabulary."

**After (Example):**
- ✅ Incorrect: "The correct answer is 'British'. Instead of saying 'tourists from the UK', the candidate used an adjective: 'British tourists'. This is efficient paraphrasing - converting a prepositional phrase into an adjective."

**Improvements:**
1. **Paraphrasing techniques explained**: Shows HOW words were transformed
2. **Grammar insights**: "converting a prepositional phrase into an adjective"
3. **Regional language differences**: Explains British vs American English variants
4. **Comparison examples**: "Compare 'tourists from the UK' with 'British tourists'"
5. **Academic register tips**: "Choose more precise vocabulary"

### Question 3: Multiple Choice Essay Organization

**Before:**
- ❌ Wrong answer: "Incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the organizational structure."

**After (Example):**
- ✅ Wrong answer: "Not quite. This focuses on SIZE and POSITION rather than the actual organizing principle. Look again: Paragraph 1 has cap, electric contact, glass bulb (all EXTERNAL/visible from outside). Paragraph 2 has stem, low pressure, inert gas (INTERNAL/inside the bulb). The organization is external vs internal, not biggest vs center vs remaining."

**Improvements:**
1. **Explains WHY it's wrong**: Identifies the flawed reasoning
2. **Shows the correct principle**: External vs internal organization
3. **Provides evidence**: Lists what's in each paragraph
4. **Teaches essay structure**: Explains why this organization is logical
5. **Specific not generic**: Addresses the exact misconception

### Question 4: Missing Element Identification

**Before:**
- ❌ Incorrect: "Not quite. Read through the description again and check which labelled part is missing."

**After:**
- ✅ Incorrect: "The correct answer is 'support wires'. Check systematically: glass bulb ✓, electrical contact ✓, metal cap ✓, stem ✓, low pressure inert gas ✓, contact wire in ✓, contact wire out ✓, tungsten filament ✓, but support wires ✗ (not mentioned). Learning point: Always verify you've described every labelled part."

**Improvements:**
1. **Systematic checking method**: Shows ALL parts with checkmarks
2. **Visual demonstration**: Uses ✓ and ✗ to show what's covered
3. **Learning strategy**: "Create a checklist of all 9 labelled parts"
4. **IELTS-specific advice**: "Always verify you've described every labelled part"
5. **Consequence awareness**: "a crucial omission that would lose marks"

## Pedagogical Principles Applied

### 1. **Scaffolding**
- Start with the answer, then explain how to find it
- Provide location hints and search strategies
- Build understanding step by step

### 2. **Metacognitive Learning**
- Teach strategies: "Tip: ...", "Strategy: ...", "Learning point: ..."
- Explain the thinking process, not just the answer
- Make learning transferable to other questions

### 3. **Specific, Not Generic**
- Quote actual text from the passage
- Reference specific paragraphs and sentences
- Show exact transformations and comparisons

### 4. **Error Analysis**
- Explain WHY a wrong answer is wrong
- Identify the misconception or mistake
- Contrast with the correct approach

### 5. **Language Awareness**
- Teach vocabulary relationships (synonyms, paraphrasing)
- Explain academic register differences
- Show grammatical transformations

### 6. **IELTS Test Strategy**
- Provide exam-specific tips and techniques
- Explain what examiners look for
- Warn about common mistakes that lose marks

## Impact on Learning

Students now receive:
- **Immediate understanding** of what the answer is
- **Clear guidance** on where to find it in the text
- **Vocabulary learning** about why words are synonyms
- **Strategic knowledge** for tackling similar questions
- **Error awareness** of common mistakes to avoid
- **Academic skills** for formal writing and paraphrasing

This transforms feedback from mere correction into active teaching.
